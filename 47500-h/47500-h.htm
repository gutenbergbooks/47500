<p class="p0">his morning, May 5, as I walked through the fields
the west wind brought to me a sweet, fresh odor,
like that of fragrant violets, precisely like that of
our little white sweet violet (<i>Viola blanda</i>). I do not
know what it came from,&mdash;probably from sugar maples,
just shaking out their fringe-like blossoms,&mdash;but it was the
first breath of May, and very welcome. April has her
odors, too, very delicate and suggestive, but seldom is the
wind perfumed with the breath of actual bloom before May. I said
it is Warbler time; the first arrivals of the pretty little migrants
should be noted now. Hardly had my thought defined itself when
before me, in a little hemlock, I caught the flash of a blue, white-barred
wing; then glimpses of a yellow breast and a yellow crown.
I approached cautiously, and in a moment more had a full view of
one of our rarer Warblers, the Blue-winged Yellow Warbler. Very
pretty he was, too, the yellow cap, the yellow breast, and the black
streak through the eye being conspicuous features. He would not
stand to be looked at long, but soon disappeared in a near-by tree.</p>

<p>The Ruby-crowned Kinglet was piping in an evergreen tree near
by, but him I had been hearing for several days. The Kinglets
come before the first Warblers, and may be known to the attentive
eye by their quick, nervous movements, and small greenish forms,
and to the discerning ear by their hurried, musical, piping strains.
How soft, how rapid, how joyous and lyrical their songs are! Very
few country people, I imagine, either see them or hear them. The
powers of observation of country people are not fine enough and
trained enough. They see and hear coarsely. An object must be
big and a sound loud, to attract their attention. Have you seen
and heard the Kinglet? If not, the finer inner world of nature is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">-&#8239;4&#8239;-</a></span>
a sealed book to you. When your senses take in the Kinglet they
will take in a thousand other objects that now escape you.</p>

<p>My first Warbler in the spring is usually the Yellow Redpoll, which
I see in April. It is not a bird of the trees and woods, but of low
bushes in the open, often alighting upon the ground in quest of
food. I sometimes see it on the lawn. The last one I saw was one
April day, when I went over to the creek to see if the suckers were
yet running up. The bird was flitting amid the low bushes, now
and then dropping down to the gravelly bank of the stream. Its
chestnut crown and yellow under parts were noticeable.</p>

<p>The past season I saw for the first time the Golden-winged
Warbler&mdash;a shy bird, that eluded me a long time in an old clearing
that had grown up with low bushes. The song first attracted my
attention, it is so like in form to that of the Black-throated Green
Back, but in quality so inferior. The first distant glimpse of the
bird, too, suggested the Green Back, so for a time I deceived myself
with the notion that it was the Green Back with some defect
in its vocal organs. A day or two later I heard two of them, and
then concluded my inference was a hasty one.</p>

<p>Following one of the birds, I caught sight of its yellow crown,
which is much more conspicuous than its yellow wing-bars. Its
song is like this, <i>'n-'n de de de</i>, with a peculiar reedy quality, but
not at all musical, falling far short of the clear, sweet, lyrical song
of the Green Back.</p>

<p>One appreciates how bright and gay the plumage of many of
our Warblers is, when he sees one of them alight upon the ground.
While passing along a wood road in June, a male Black-throated
Green came down out of the hemlocks and sat for a moment on
the ground before me. How out of place he looked, like a bit of
ribbon or millinery just dropped there! The throat of this Warbler
always suggests the finest black velvet. Not long after I saw the
Chestnut-sided Warbler do the same thing. We were trying to make
it out in a tree by the roadside, when it dropped down quickly to
the ground in pursuit of an insect, and sat a moment upon the
brown surface, giving us a vivid sense of its bright new plumage.</p>

<p>When the leaves of the trees are just unfolding, or, as Tennyson
says, "When all the woods stand in a mist of green, and nothing
perfect," the tide of migrating Warblers is at its height. They
come in the night, and in the morning the trees are alive with
them. The apple trees are just showing the pink, and how closely
the birds inspect them in their eager quest for insect food! One
cold, rainy day at this season Wilson's Black-cap,&mdash;a bird that is
said to go north nearly to the arctic circle,&mdash;explored an apple tree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">-&#8239;5&#8239;-</a></span>
in front of my window. It came down within two feet of my face,
as I stood by the pane, and paused a moment in its hurry and
peered in at me, giving me an admirable view of its form and
markings. It was wet and hungry, and it had a long journey before
it. What a small body to cover such a distance!</p>

<p>The Black-poll Warbler, which one may see about the same
time, is a much larger bird and of slower movement, and is
colored much like the Black and White Creeping Warbler with a
black cap on its head. The song of this bird is the finest, the least
in volume, and most insect-like of that of any Warbler known to me.
It is the song of the Black and White Creeper reduced, high and
swelling in the middle and low and faint at its beginning and ending.
When one has learned to note and discriminate the Warblers,
he has made a good beginning in his or her ornithological studies.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="John_Burroughs_at_Slab_Sides"></a>John Burroughs at 'Slab Sides'</p>

<div class="dropcap">S</div>
<p class="p0">ome years ago a favor to a neighbor resulted in Mr. Burroughs
acquiring possession of a small 'muck swamp' situated
in a valley in the hills, a mile or more west of his home
at West Park, on the Hudson. To Mr. Burroughs, the agriculturist,
this apparently worthless bit of ground promised a rich return after
it had yielded to successive attacks of brush-knife, grubbing-hook,
plough, and spade. To Burroughs, the literary naturalist and nature-lover,
this secluded hollow in the woods offered a retreat to which
he could retire when his eyes wearied of the view of nature tamed
and trimmed, from his study on the bank of the Hudson.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1895 the muck swamp was a seemingly hopeless
tangle of brush and bogs, without sign of human habitation.
One year later its black bed was lined with long rows of luxuriant
celery, while from a low point at one end of the swamp
had arisen a rustic cabin fitting the scene so harmoniously that
one had to look twice to see it.</p>

<p>This is 'Slab Sides,' a dwelling of Mr. Burroughs' own planning,
and, in part, construction, its outer covering of rough sawn
slabs, which still retain their bark, being the origin of its name.
In a future number we hope to present a photograph of the exterior
of Slab Sides, with an account of the birds its owner finds about it.
Part of its interior is well shown by our photograph of Mr. Burroughs
seated before the fireplace, in which, as head mason and
stone-cutter, he takes a justifiable pride. Here, from April to
November, Mr. Burroughs makes his home, and here his most sympathetic
readers may imagine him amid surroundings which are in keeping
with the character of his writings.</p>

<p class="p0">nyone having an earnest interest in both natural
history and photography can find no more delightful
and profitable way of spending leisure
hours than by prying into the secrets of Dame
Nature with an instrument capable of furnishing such complete
and truthful information as the camera. Delightful and fascinating,
because it not only gives worthy purpose and charming zest
to all outing trips, but yields results that tell in no uncertain way
of things and incidents that it would be well nigh impossible to
preserve in any other manner. There is no department of nature-study
in which the camera cannot be turned to excellent account,
and while records of lasting and scientific value are being made,
the devotee of amateur photography has at the same time full
scope for the study of his art. What may, perhaps, be considered
the greatest value, albeit an unrecognized one, of the present widespread
camera craze, is the development of a love for the beautiful
and artistic which may result, and along the line of study here suggested
may surely be found abundant material to stimulate in the
highest degree these qualities. Too much time is spent and too
much effort expended by the average 'kodaker' in what has been
aptly termed "reminiscent photography," the results being of but
momentary interest and of no particular value to anybody.</p>

<p>In the present and subsequent articles, it is intended to illustrate
by pictures actually taken in the field by the veriest tyro in
the art of photography, what may be accomplished by any properly
equipped amateur in the way of securing portraits of our native
birds in their wild state and amid their natural surroundings. Supplemental
to such portraits are the more easily taken photographs
of the nests, eggs, young, and natural haunts of each species; the
whole graphically depicting the most interesting epoch in the life-history
of any bird. Words alone fail to tell the story so clearly,
so beautifully, and so forcibly. And, best of all, this can be accomplished
without carrying bloodshed and destruction into the
ranks of our friends the birds; for we all love to call the birds
our friends, yet some of us are not, I fear, always quite friendly
in our dealings with them. To take their pictures and pictures of
their homes is a peaceful and harmless sort of invasion of their
domains, and the results in most cases are as satisfactory and far-reaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">-&#8239;7&#8239;-</a></span>
as to bring home as trophies lifeless bodies and despoiled
habitations, to be stowed away in cabinets where dust and insects
and failing interest soon put an end to their usefulness. It is not
intended, of course, to reflect in any way upon the establishment of
orderly and well-directed collections, for such are absolutely necessary
to the very existence of the science of ornithology. To such
collections the great body of amateur bird students should turn
for the close examinations necessary to familiarize themselves with
the principles of classification and the distinctions between closely
related species. Indeed, it is impossible for anyone to be intelligently
informed as to the many varieties of birds, and their wonderful
seasonal changes of plumage, without having actually handled
specimens.</p>

</div>

<p>The growth of avian photography has been of short duration,&mdash;only
a few years in this country and not much longer in England,
where it seems to have had its inception. But there are already
one or two good books dealing with the subject; and a goodly number
of ornithological works of recent date, and especially the pages
of the journal literature of the day, bear excellent testimony to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">-&#8239;8&#8239;-</a></span>
merit and beauty of this method of securing bird pictures. Attention,
however, has thus far been directed chiefly to obtaining
illustrations of nests and eggs and captive birds, to the neglect
of the more difficult but more interesting occupation of securing
photographs of live birds in their wild state. Herein lies the
chief fascination of this branch of photography, for good photographs
from life of any of our birds, even the most common, are
still novelties.</p>

<p>The successful bird photographer must possess a good camera,
including a first-class lens, with at least an elementary knowledge
of how to get the best results from it; some acquaintance with
field and forest and their feathered inhabitants, and a fund of
patience, perseverance, and determination to conquer that is absolutely
inexhaustible. No matter how well equipped in other respects,
this latter requisite cannot be dispensed with. As to the
technique and many details of the art of photography, the writer
is still too much of a novice to speak very intelligently. Suffice
it to say, that the general principles governing other branches of
photography are to be consulted here. One great difficulty to be
encountered is that there is little opportunity to arrange the lighting
or background of the object to be photographed, and as the
latter is apt to be either green foliage or the dull ground, with
the camera very near the object, the beginner will be much perplexed
to determine the proper stop and the right time of exposure.
With the usual appliances a wide open stop will be found
necessary with the rapid exposure required, and this will detract
in a disappointing manner from the beauty of the negative as a
whole. But every determined student will try in his or her own
way to lessen these defects, and will find in failure only increased
incentive to discover better methods and better appliances. Cameras
and lenses especially devised for this kind of work are promised in
the near future. A rapid telephoto lens is a great desideratum, and
there is reason to believe that in the near future such an one will
be available. Those to be had at present increase the time of exposure
too much to be generally useful in bird work. The writer
has used a 4 × 5 long-focus 'Premo' with Bausch and Lomb Rapid
Rectilinear lens (Zeiss-Anastigmat, Series II-A, 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> × 6<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>), the focal
length of the combination being about 6<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches. Many kinds
of plates have been used, but any good rapid plate will do. For
those who are willing to take the additional care necessary to
handle them successfully, rapid isochromatic or orthochromatic plates
are undoubtedly to be preferred, as they preserve quite clearly the
color values.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">-&#8239;9&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p>A consideration of the actual field difficulties, rather than the more
purely photographic problems to be encountered, is more within the
scope of the present paper. To this end a rather detailed account
is given of just how each of the following groups of photographs
was secured, hoping that others better equipped, with a
better knowledge of photography, and with more leisure, may be
encouraged to go and do likewise and present us with the results.</p>

<p>One of the greatest of these field difficulties is that the camera
is rarely focused upon the bird to be taken, but is either snapped
at random or focused upon some spot to which the bird is expected
to return. The latter, in the great majority of cases, is the nest; at
other times a much-used perching-place or feeding-ground. Success
depends, therefore, very largely upon the nature, disposition, and
habits, especially nesting habits, of the particular bird being dealt
with. Some birds are of a confiding, unsuspicious nature, and easily
reconciled to quiet intrusion; while others are so timid and wary
that hours of time have to be expended, and all sorts of devices
resorted to, in order to get the coveted 'snap.' Of the risk of
life and limb necessary to reach rocky cliff and lofty tree-dwelling
species, the recital must come from such daring and fearless devotees
of this art as the Kearton brothers of England, and others
nearer home.</p>

<p>The nest being the lure usually employed to bring the bird
within range of the camera, it will follow that the nesting season
is the time of year when most of this work must be done. Thus,
spring and early summer are the harvest time of the bird photographer,
and as it happens that these, of all the seasons, are the
most delightful in which to be afield, the bird-lover, with glass,
camera, and note-book, can leave care behind and find contentment,
rest, and peaceful profit in the glorious days of June, so
happily styled the rarest of all that come.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">CHICKADEE LEAVING NEST</span>
</div>

<p>Leaving general considerations, let us first study a series of
photographs that well illustrates what charming and dainty little
pictures can sometimes be secured with most trifling effort. Success
in this instance was easily attained because the little 'sitters'
were not very unwilling and because the conditions under which
they lived were more than usually favorable. The subject of these
photographs, the little Black-capped Chickadee, or Titmouse,&mdash;<i>Parus
atricapillus</i>, the scientists call him,&mdash;is familiarly known to almost
every one who has given even casual attention to birds. Its generally
common occurrence throughout the United States, cheery,
happy disposition, and lively notes as the little band, for they
usually travel in companies, goes roaming through woodland and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">-&#8239;10&#8239;-</a></span>
copse, endears it to all. All through the long, dreary winter, with
its short days and perpetual snow and ice, they are the same
sprightly, contented little fellows, and refreshing it is to meet and
visit with them at such times as they come 'chick-a-de-dee'-ing
right into your very presence in their familiar, confiding way.
Springtime finds them with a
mellow, long-drawn love whistle
of two notes and thoughts of
home and home-like things. Soon,
down by the lake or brook-side,
or in some moist woodland glade,
where birch and willow trunks
long since dead and soft with
age stand sheltered among the
growing trees, the little Black-cap
and his chosen mate pick
out a cozy retreat. This, perhaps,
is some deserted Woodpecker
den, decayed knothole,
or more often it is a burrow of
their own making, and here they
assume the delights and cares of
wedded life. A snug, warm nest
of rabbit's hair or fern down is
quickly built, and in this softest
of beds the five or six rosy
white, finely speckled little eggs are laid. Before very many days,
eight or ten at most, the old stump exhibits unmistakable signs
of being animated within, and in a wonderfully short time the
little nestlings are as large as their parents, and full, indeed, is
this family domicile. Owing to the cleanly habits and care of the
old birds, the dresses of the youngsters are cleaner and brighter
than those of their hard-worked, food-carrying parents. It was
just at this stage in their progress that the little family, whose
portraits are here shown, was discovered one late June day, snugly
ensconced within the crumbling trunk of a long since departed
willow tree. With a bird-loving companion, Mr. Leslie O. Dart,
the writer was drifting idly in a little boat through one of the many
channels of the Mississippi river, which cut up into innumerable
islands, the heavily wooded bottomland of eastern Houston county,
Minnesota. Being in search of the nests of numerous Prothonotary
Warblers, which were flashing hither and thither across the channel,
we skirted the shore closely, tapping on all likely-looking stubs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">-&#8239;11&#8239;-</a></span>
Now the tapping brought to view a Downy Woodpecker, then a
beautiful Golden Swamp Warbler; sometimes unexpectedly a great
gray mouse scrambled out and plunged boldly into the water beneath;
but this time the blow was followed by a subdued hum
from within, and an inquiring, anxious parent Chickadee appeared
suddenly on the scene, joined in a moment by a second, and we
had the family complete. It was near noon, the sun was shining
brightly, the hole was on the water side of the stub in the light,
and we had no Chickadee pictures; so we camped at once and
prepared to 'do' the situation. A little investigation showed the
nest to be too high for setting up the camera satisfactorily, as the
tripod legs sank deep in the mud and water. But our kit included
a saw for just such an emergency, and sawing off the soft
stub at the proper height, it was lowered gently until the hole came
just on a level with the camera, placed horizontally and at a distance
of about three feet. Propped with a forked stick, it rested
quite securely on the soft bottom. This was better than tipping
the camera and employing the 'swing back,' as the sun was nearly
overhead. After focusing carefully on the opening in the stub,
attaching to the camera fifty feet of small rubber tubing with large
bulb, in place of the usual short tube and small bulb, setting carefully
the trigger and other accessories of our harmless gun, and
covering the whole camera with a hood of rough green cloth, the
lens alone visible, we retreated to a convenient vantage point among
the small willows close by. But a few minutes elapsed before the
old birds were on the spot peering at us and the big green object
from all sides. In an incredibly short space of time, considering
the great liberties that had been taken with their habitation and
door yard, they became resigned, and one of the birds, which we
assumed to be the female, flew straight to the stub, and, with a
last suspicious glance at the great glistening eye so near at hand,
disappeared into the hole with a large brown worm in her bill.
But that momentary delay was the looked-for opportunity, and all-sufficient;
for with a quick squeeze of the bulb, click went the
shutter, and in the twenty-fifth of a second the bird was ours; shot
without so much as knowing it, without indeed the ruffling of a
feather or the drawing of a drop of blood, and preserved life-like
and true to nature for all time to come.</p>

<p>From this time on the birds came and went without hesitation,
the only serious delays in our operations being due to the drifting
clouds, which now and then obscured the sun and rendered the
light too weak for the rapid exposures necessary. One of the birds,
the one we took to be the female, was a little more courageous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">-&#8239;12&#8239;-</a></span>
than the other, and it is her picture that appears oftenest. The
timid one,&mdash;the male,&mdash;even went so far on several occasions as to
himself devour the worm he had brought rather than trust himself
at close quarters with the unknown enemy, although his mate was
at the time coming and going industriously and keeping the little
folk well supplied with the great larv&aelig;. Surely personal traits and
individuality are quite as well marked in the bird world as higher
in the scale! After we had made several more exposures similar
to the first, one of the best of which shows the bird, worm-laden
as before, balanced on the edge of the hole and taking the usual
last look at the camera, we turned our attention to catching her as
she was coming out. This required quicker co&ouml;peration between
eye and hand, as the exit was generally made with a dash; but the
accompanying picture, with head just emerging, will show that we
were fairly successful.</p>

<p>Having concluded from all indications, chief among which was
the immense number of huge caterpillars carried in to the young,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">-&#8239;13&#8239;-</a></span>
that the latter must be fairly grown, we decided to expose the nest
and complete our collection by securing the entire family. So carefully
sawing away the front wall of the cavity with a keyhole saw
carried for just such purposes, we gave the little fellows within their
first view of the outside world. I fear they must have thought the
manner of opening their second shell a rather rude one, and the outlook
somewhat forbidding. They were pretty little youngsters, fully
grown, with clean, jaunty coats, and a grown-up 'chickadee-dee,' just
like the old folks. Though somewhat dazzled at first by the sudden
flood of bright sunlight, they were, after a little coaxing, induced to sit
out on the veranda that had been improvised for them; but, like youthful
sitters generally, they were hard to pose, and after many exposures,
we succeeded in getting no more than two of them at once. The
prettiest one of all, showing two of the little fellows as they finally
settled down contentedly in the warm sunshine, was obtained at the
expense of much patient effort and a great deal of slushing back and
forth in mud and water between boat and camera, and it was gratifying
to find that one at least of the negatives did fair justice to the situation.</p>

<p>The old ones came and went after the mutilation of their home,
just as before, and, indeed, apparently found the new arrangement
much more convenient than the old. In one of the photographs
here presented, domestic
affairs that had before
been entirely concealed
from view are fully revealed,
and had not the
plate been light-struck by
one of the many aggravating
accidents likely to occur
in the out-door work of
the beginner, the picture
would have been the best
of the series. The courageous
parent is attending
to her maternal duties under
circumstances which
must appear most appalling.
The little fellow sitting
so contentedly by has
undoubtedly had his share
of the huge juicy caterpillars,
and patiently recognizes
that it is not his turn.</p>

<p class="p0">uring the winter of 1897-8 I prospected for Jurassic
fossils in Carbon and Albany counties, Wyoming.
When cold weather and snow rendered field work impracticable
as well as very disagreeable, I made permanent
camp for the winter at Aurora, Wyoming,&mdash;a mere station
on the Union Pacific R. R., an old abandoned section-house
serving as my winter quarters.</p>

<p>This part of Wyoming,&mdash;at all times dreary and lonely,&mdash;is
strikingly so during winter months. Then snow fills
the ravines and lends a level, prairie-like aspect to the landscape.
I doubt if there is to be found anywhere a more desolate country
than this; at least such was my impression when the novelty of my
surroundings had worn off.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/pg_14b.png" width="425" height="310" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">HORNED LARKS AND SNOWFLAKES</span>
</div>

<p>Among the various expedients to which I resorted for amusement,
was photographing such birds as I could lure around the cabin.
That I was not more successful in securing good negatives is due to
the difficulties with which I had to contend. Chief of these were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">-&#8239;15&#8239;-</a></span>
fierce, wintry blasts sweeping over the plains and filling the air
with snow and dust.</p>

<p>A single experiment taught me the inadvisability of leaving the
camera exposed for any length of time to these conditions. I had
been trying to get a large photograph of Horned Larks. The camera
was placed on the ground and a handful of oats scattered before it,
while I waited within the cabin for nearly two hours for an opportunity
to pull the thread attached to the camera shutter. But the
birds persistently avoided the pebble marking the focal plane, and
clouds continually obscured the sun when I wished to make an exposure.
At last the right moment came, I pulled the thread, and hurried
out to get the result. That plate was never developed. Snow had
clogged the shutter, and I found it had remained wide open after
being sprung.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/pg_15.png" width="370" height="296" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">HORNED LARKS AND SNOWFLAKES</span>
</div>

<p>By throwing oats on only one spot, and that close to the window,
I soon gathered quite a flock of Horned Larks, who came regularly
every morning to feed from the constantly replenished supply.
Finally, after a week of gloomy, dark weather, a cloudless sky offered
especially good chances for a photograph of my feathered friends.
This time I placed the camera on the window-sill. Maneuvers
attendant upon focusing and inserting a plate-holder, of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">-&#8239;16&#8239;-</a></span>
frightened the birds away. They were back again within a few
minutes, but an unexpected source of annoyance interfered. A freight
train stopped opposite the scene of my operations and belched great
billows of smoke between the sun and the birds. Also the shadow
of the cabin was gradually encroaching on the feeding ground. I
made a trial exposure, however, and obtained a very good negative.
But a shadow in the foreground and a wagon tongue in the rear, did
not add to the pictorial effect of the group.</p>

<p>After much pulling and prying, I pushed the objectionable wagon
out of the drifts, and put off further photographing until the next
morning. The morning came as bright and sunny as I desired. My
feathered subjects were early in the open air studio, and required no
conventional admonition to 'look pleasant.' In fact, they were
almost too lively for the camera shutter. The negative obtained
proved very good, and well repaid me for all trouble and annoyance.</p>

<img src="images/pg_16.png" width="351" height="253" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">YELLOW-HEADED BLACKBIRDS</span>
</div>

<p>A few Yellow-headed Blackbirds were attracted by the food supply
I furnished, and I made several negatives of them. The Yellow-heads
were more wary than the Horned Larks, and flew away at the slightest
disturbance. Only a few at a time gathered beneath the window, while
the others perched on fence-posts at a safe distance and kept watch.</p>

<p>But it remained for a Northern Shrike to add 'insult to injury,' by
seizing a dead mouse I had placed on a post and alighting on the
camera with its capture!</p>

<p class="p0">t is a simple matter enough, with the little folk who
happily live in the country, to excite an interest and
develop a familiar friendship with their bird neighbors.
The birds can easily be coaxed to the piazza or
the window-shelf by the judicious offer of free lunch, and
so a speaking acquaintance, perhaps even a life-long
friendship, with them may be gained.</p>

<p>But with city children, especially those of the poorer
classes, the case is very different. The question how to
teach them to know and care for birds is by no means so easy.</p>

<p>Look at their case: they have seen no birds but English Sparrows
and caged Canaries and Parrots; few of them know the Robin;
they practically never go to the country, and many of them never even
go to the parks. How shall they be taught about birds? Observing
the rule of advancing from known to unknown, would suggest Dick
the Canary, as the obvious point of departure from a tenement into
the world of birds; then, perhaps, the Summer Yellow-bird in the
park, commonly known as the 'Wild Canary,' and then Mr. Goldfinch
and his little olive-brown spouse, who would make a natural
transition to the brown Sparrow family, and so on. The difficulty
here is that it is so nearly impossible to get city children up to the
park to see the Yellow-bird.</p>

<p>So another method, involving no country walks and no live birds,
has to be resorted to. We may use pictures,&mdash;drawn before the class
and colored, if possible,&mdash;and, trusting to the children's powers of
imagination and idealization, may connect with their experience at
some other point. After studying about the carpenter, in kindergarten
or primary school, for instance, it is easy to interest children in the
Woodpecker by proposing to tell them about a "little carpenter bird;"
after talking of the fisherman, a promise to tell them of a bird who
is a fisherman is sure to stir their imaginations of the doings of the
Kingfisher, and so with the weaver (Oriole), mason (Robin) and
others.</p>

<p>When several birds have been learned, the best kind of review for
little people is probably some game like the following, which has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">-&#8239;18&#8239;-</a></span>
played with most tumultuous enthusiasm and eager interest in a certain
New York school of poor children. The teacher says:</p>

<p>"Let's play 'I'm thinking of a bird.' All shut your eyes tight
and think. Now, I'm thinking of a bird nearly as large as a Pigeon;
he is brownish, with black barring on the back, black spots all over
the breast," etc., etc., giving a description of the Yellow Hammer,
or Flicker, but leaving the characteristic marks until the end of the
description. Before the teacher has gone far, a dozen hands are waving
wildly and several vociferous whispers are heard, proclaiming in
furious pianissimo: "<i>I</i> know," "<i>I</i> know what it is." Then the child
who gets it right is allowed to describe a bird for the class to guess,
and if the description fails in any point the class may offer corrections.</p>

<p>This appeal to the play instinct excites great interest, which is
the thing chiefly to be desired.</p>

<p>When a number of birds have been learned in this way, a trip to
the Natural History Museum would be of very great value, especially
noticing the wonderful reproductions of actual scenes from bird-life
there displayed. In this way city children could see in a single day
more real bird-life than they could otherwise get in a year, as their
few country days are generally populous picnics, from which the birds
flee aghast.</p>

<p>The children should take their kindergarten principles of observation
and conversational description to the Museum with them, and,
on returning to school, should draw and color some bird they have
seen. To observe and describe and, perhaps, draw each new bird
whose picture is shown in the classroom is also a good thing. The
writer passed a mounted Flicker through a class of fifty children of
kindergarten age, let them look and carefully handle, and then asked
for "stories" about it. One child said: "I know&mdash;Oh&mdash;I know
seven stories&mdash;no, eight&mdash;<i>nine</i> stories about Mr. Yellow Hammer,"
and she really did know her nine "stories."</p>

<p>When they have gone as far as this, most bird stories will
interest them, especially if the birds are humanized for them by the
teller of the tale.</p>

<p>To sum up, it may be said that the best way to begin is to teach a
few birds well,&mdash;a dozen or so,&mdash;by connecting with the child's experience,
in some way, the information to be given, and then employing
the play instinct by having bird games of various kinds, both kindergarten
bird games and others; observation, description and drawing
of birds may follow, and first and last, and all the time, all descriptions
and stories given to children should be in terms of human nature.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">A</span>lthough we have fewer birds during the winter
than at any other season, at no other time during
the year do the comparative advantages of
ornithology as a field study seem so evident.
The botanist and entomologist now find little out of doors
to attract them, and, if we except a stray squirrel or rabbit,
birds are the only living things we may see from December to March.
Winter, therefore, is a good time to begin the study of birds, not
only because flowers and insects do not then claim our attention,
but also because the small number of birds then present is a most
encouraging circumstance to the opera-glass student, who, in identifying
birds, is at the mercy of a 'key.'</p>

<p>Indeed, the difficulty now lies not in identification, but in discovery;
unless one is thoroughly familiar with a given locality and
its bird-life, one may walk for miles and not see a feather&mdash;a particularly
unfortunate state of affairs if one has a bird-class in charge.
This dilemma, however, may be avoided by catering to the dominant
demand of bird-life at this season, the demand for food. Given a supply
of the proper kind of food, and birds in the winter may nearly
always be found near it. Bird seed and grain may be used, but a less
expensive diet, and one which will doubtless be more appreciated,
consists of sweepings from the hay-loft containing the seeds to which
our birds are accustomed. This may be scattered by the bushel or
in a sufficient quantity to insure a hearty meal for all visiting Juncos
and Tree Sparrows, with perhaps less common winter seed-eaters.</p>

<p>The bark-hunting Woodpeckers, Nuthatches, and Chickadees will
require different fare, and meat-bones, suet, bacon-rinds and the like
have been found to be acceptable substitutes for their usual repast
of insects' eggs and larv&aelig;.</p>

<p>Winter, strange as it may seem, is an excellent season for bird-nesting.
The trees and bushes now give up the secrets they guarded
from us so successfully during the summer, and we examine them
with as much interest as we pore over the 'Answers to Puzzles in
Preceding Number' department of a favorite magazine.</p>

<p>Immediately after a snow storm is the best time in which to
hunt for birds' nests in the winter. Then all tree and bush nests
have a white cap, which renders them more conspicuous.</p>

<p>When walking with children, the spirit of competition may be
aroused by saying "Who'll see the first nest," or "Who'll see the
next nest first," as the case may be, and the number discovered
under this impetus is often surprising.</p>

<div class="dropcap">D</div>
<p class="p0">on't think that I mean the House, or English
Sparrow, for he is quite a different bird.
Our little doorstep friend is the very smallest
of all the brown Sparrows you know, and wears a
reddish brown cap, and a gray vest so plain it
hasn't a single button or stripe on it. He is a
dear, plump little bird, who sits in the sun and
throws up his head and chippers away so happily that people call him
the Chipping Sparrow.</p>

<p>He comes to the doorstep and looks up at you as if he knew you
wanted to feed him, and if you scatter crumbs on the piazza he will
pick them up and hop about on the floor as if it were his piazza as
well as yours.</p>

<p>One small Chippy, whom his friends called Dick, used to light on
the finger of the kind man who fed him, and use his hand for dining-room,
and sometimes when he had had a very nice breakfast, he would
hop up on a finger, perch, and sing a happy song!</p>

<p>Dick was so sure his friends were kind and good, that as soon as
his little birds were out of the nest, he brought them to be fed too.
They did not know what a nice dining-room a hand makes, so they
wouldn't fly up to it, but when the gentleman held their bread and
seeds close to the ground, they would come and help themselves.</p>


<p class="caption3">CHIPPY'S NEST.</p>

<p>If you were a bird and were going to build a nest, where would
you put it? At the end of a row of your brothers' nests, as the
Eave Swallows do? Or would that be too much like living in a
row of brick houses in the city? Chipping Sparrows don't like to
live too close to their next door neighbors. They don't mind if a
Robin is in the same tree, on another bough, but they want their
own branch all to themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">-&#8239;21&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<span class="fig_caption">TAMING A CHIPPY</span>
</div>

<p>Photographed by Mr. George Wood at the home of Lieutenant Wirt Robinson, in
Virginia. Lieutenant Robinson writes that a pair of Chipping Sparrows placed their
nest in the climbing rose bush at the end of the piazza. One of the pair, supposed
to be the female, was easily tamed with the aid of bread crumbs, and for three
successive years she returned to the piazza, always immediately resuming her habits
of familiarity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">-&#8239;22&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p>And they want it to be a branch, too. Other birds may build
their nests on the ground, or burrow in the ground, or dig holes in
tree trunks, or even hang their nests down inside dark chimneys if
they like, but Chippy doesn't think much of such places. He wants
plenty of daylight and fresh air.</p>

<p>But even if you have made up your mind to build on a branch,
think how many nice trees and bushes there are to choose from, and
how hard it must be to decide on one. You'd have to think a long
time and look in a great many places. You see you want the safest,
best spot in all the world in which to hide away your pretty eggs,
and the precious birdies that will hatch out of them. They must be
tucked well out of sight, for weasels and cats, and many other giants
like eggs and nestlings for breakfast.</p>

<p>If you could find a kind family fond of birds, don't you think it
would be a good thing to build near them? Perhaps they would
drive away the cats and help protect your brood. Then on hot
summer days maybe some little girl would think to put out a pan
of water for a drink and a cool bath. Some people, like Dick's
friends, are so thoughtful they throw out crumbs to save a tired
mother bird the trouble of having to hunt for every morsel she
gets to give her brood. Just think what work it is to find worms
enough for four children who want food from daylight to dark!</p>

<p>The vines of a piazza make a safe, good place for a nest if you
are sure the people haven't a cat, and love birds. I once saw a
Chippy's nest in the vines of a dear old lady's house, and when she
would come out to see how the eggs were getting on she would talk
so kindly to the old birds it was very pleasant to live there. In such
a place your children are protected, they have a roof over their little
heads so the rains won't beat down on them, and the vines shade
them nicely from the hot sun.</p>

<p>When you are building your house everything you want to use
will be close by. On the lawn you will find the soft grasses you
want for the outside, and in the barnyard you can get the long horse
hairs that all Chipping Sparrows think they must have for a dry,
cool nest-lining. Hair-birds, you know Chippies are called, they
use so much hair. The question is how can they ever find it unless
they do live near a barn? You go to look for it, someday, out on
a country road or in a pasture. It takes sharp eyes and a great
deal of patience, I guess you'll find them. But if you live on the
piazza of a house, with a barn in the back yard, you can find so
many nice long hairs that you can sometimes make your whole nest
of them. I have seen a Chippy's nest that hadn't another thing in
it&mdash;that was just a coil of black horse hair.</p>

<p>After you have built your nest and are looking for food for
your young it is most convenient to be near a house. The worms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">-&#8239;23&#8239;-</a></span>
you want for your nestlings are in the garden, and the seeds you
like for a lunch for yourself are on the weeds mixed up with the lawn
grass. You needn't mind taking them, either, for the people you
live with will be only too glad to get rid of them, because their
flowers are killed by the worms, and their lawns look badly when
weeds grow in the grass, so you will only be helping the kind
friends who have already helped you. Don't you think that will
be nice?</p>


<p class="caption3">CHIPPY'S FAMILY.</p>

<p>Did you ever look into a Chippy's nest? The eggs are a pretty
blue and have black dots on the larger end.</p>

<p>When the little birds first come out of the shell their eyes are
shut tight, like those of little kittens when they are first born.</p>

<p>If you are very gentle you can stroke the backs of the little ones
as they sit waiting for the old birds to feed them.</p>

<p>I remember one plum tree nest on a branch so low that a little
girl could look into it. One day when the mother bird was brooding
the eggs the little girl crept close up to the tree, so close she
could look into Mother Chippy's eyes, and the trustful bird never
stirred, but just sat and looked back at her. "Isn't she tame?" the
child cried, she was so happy over it.</p>

<p>There was another Chippy's nest in an evergreen by the house,
and when the old birds were hunting for worms we used to feed
the nestlings bread crumbs. They didn't mind the bread not being
worms so long as it was something to eat. It would have made you
laugh to see how wide they opened their bills! It seemed as if the
crumbs could drop clear down to their boots! Wouldn't you like to
feed a little family like that sometime?</p>

<p>In June, six or seven years ago, my
daughters found in the courtyard of our
home, a young House or English Sparrow
who had evidently fallen from the
nest, and had broken its leg in the fall.
They took it in and cared for it, binding
up the injured limb and feeding it as
experience with other birds of the same
family had taught them to do. Happily,
the bird recovered, and in a short time
became quite a pet of the household.</p>

<p>At that time we had two Canary Birds,
both beautiful singers, and in almost
constant song. The Sparrow was in the
same room with them, and very soon
(making use of its imitative power,
which we have observed is a strong
characteristic of the Sparrow) acquired
the full and complete song of the Canaries.
We followed with much pleasure
the unfolding of his musical ability,
which was gradual, and found that he
had surpassed his teachers, producing
melodies much richer and stronger, as
all who had the pleasure of listening to
him freely admitted.</p>

<p>The bird retained his song to the last,
although as age came upon him, as with
all other pet birds, his singing was less
and less frequent till he passed away,
some few months ago. Besides imitating
the song of the Canary, he acquired the
song of a bird in our collection known
as the 'Strawberry Finch,' which he
gave perfectly. His plumage was greatly
improved by his confinement and the
very great care given him, so much so,
that one almost doubted his being an
English Sparrow till convinced upon closer
examination.</p>

<p>We have had a large experience with
these birds; they become very affectionate
with petting, and show a wonderful
degree of intelligence.</p>

<p>I would further say that our Sparrow
had all the notes common to the English
Sparrow, beside his acquired accomplishments,
and there was sadness in our home
when his little life went out.&mdash;<span class="smcap">John L.

<p>On October 14, 1898, while on a short
visit to my old home, at New Baltimore,
New York, I sat down near a clump of
trees and shrubs to enjoy the bird-life so
abundant there.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">ACORN WEDGED IN BARK BY WHITE-BREASTED NUTHATCH<br />

Photographed from Nature, by E. B. Southwick</span>
</div>

<p>Here I saw the Chickadee carefully
examining the fruit-heads of the smooth
sumach, and twice take from them a mass
of spider-web; then, flying to a limb,
dissect it and obtain from it the mass of
young or eggs. It was with difficulty that
the food was disentangled from the silk,
and I found on examination that much of
it had been so crushed, that it was impossible
to determine whether the web
contained eggs or young.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, I saw a White-breasted
Nuthatch, with something in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">-&#8239;25&#8239;-</a></span>
beak, alight on the trunk of a wild cherry
tree. While running about over the bark,
the bird dropped what proved to be an
acorn, but immediately flew down and
picked it from the long grass, and returned
to the tree. A second time it
dropped it, and then, after carrying it
again to the tree, thrust it into a crevice
in the bark with considerable force, and
began to peck at it vigorously. This it
did for a few seconds, when I jumped up
quickly and, with wild gesticulations,
frightened it away. It proved to be the
acorn of the pin Oak (<i>Quercus palustris</i>),
and as no fruiting tree of this species was
nearer than the Island, in the river opposite,
I concluded that the bird had carried
it across the water from that point.</p>

<p>After photographing the acorn on the
tree, I cut the section of bark off, glued
the acorn in its cavity, and the photograph
shows the result.&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. B. Southwick</span>, <i>New

<p>This interesting sketch was contributed

the world of this remarkably artistic effort,
and therefore present it for the edification

<p class="caption2"><a name="Collecting_a_Brown_Thrashers_Song" id="Collecting_a_Brown_Thrashers_Song">Collecting a Brown Thrasher's Song</a></p>


<p>Rustler, my pet Brown Thrasher, was
pouring out his loud, long, spring song. A
phonograph, or rather a graphophone, had
been left on a table by the cage. Everything
seemed to favor the collection of a
bird song. I placed the instrument so
that the open funnel of the horn came
within less than a foot of the Thrasher's
swelling throat, and touching a lever, set
the wax cylinder revolving below a sapphire-tipped
style, which cut the bird notes into
the wax. Just as the medley changed
from that of a Catbird to that of a Wood
Thrush, a Robin flew past the window.
Rustler stopped short, but the style continued
to cut and ruin the wax cylinder.
When Rustler started in again he hopped
to the opposite side of the cage, rudely
turning his back upon the graphophone.</p>

<p>More than a little vexed at the perversity
of dumb animals, I quickly covered
over the end of the cage farthest from
the graphophone; then Rustler sulked
beneath the cloth in silence. Next I
removed the perch from that side and
then Rustler absolutely refused to sing
any more. Some hours later, however, I
made another attempt, but each time the
graphophone was started the whir of the
revolving cylinder cut short my Thrasher's
rich, rippling notes, so that the only thing
to do was to remove the recording style
and accustom him to the noise of the cylinder,
and when this had been accomplished,
I replaced the recording style. I
found that by shutting off the graphophone
the instant Rustler's notes became weak
or stopped, I could catch a continuous
series of notes. I succeeded the following
morning in getting a pretty fair song.
It was not so loud as it might have been,
but in pitch and timbre it was perfect.</p>

<p>In September dear old Rustler died.
For nine long years he had enlivened my
northern New Jersey home with his cheery
music. In November, at a meeting of the
American Ornithologists' Union, the notes
of Rustler's love song fell sweetly upon
sympathetic ears.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sylvester D. Judd,

<p>Authors may or may not be indebted to
reviewers of their works, but it is not
often that reviewers are under obligations
to the authors of the works they review.
In the present instance, however, we feel
that we must express our gratitude to the
Messrs. Kearton for furnishing us with
such an admirable demonstration of the
kind of ornithology for which this journal
stands. If, following the same lines, we
can bring <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> to the high standard
reached in 'With Nature and a Camera,'
we shall have nearly approached our ideal.</p>

<p>Briefly, this book is a record of observation
and photography by two ornithologists
in Great Britain. Doubtless, no
birds in the world have been more written
about than the birds of this region, and
still this book is filled with fresh and original
matter, which is always interesting,
and often of real scientific value.</p>

<p>Asked to explain how it was that in such
a well-worked field the author of this
volume had succeeded in securing so much
new material, we should reply that we
believed it was because he was an observer
rather than a collector. Apparently
realizing that to collect specimens
of British birds would add but little to
the store of our knowledge concerning
them, he has devoted his time to a study
of their habits, and in presenting the results
of his labors, he has been most ably
seconded by his brother, whose photographs
of birds in nature have not, so far
as we know, been excelled.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most forcible lesson taught
by this book is the pleasure to be derived
from photographing wild birds in nature,
and the surprisingly good results which
may be achieved by patient, intelligent
effort. We do not recall a more adequately
illustrated nature book, and its
pictures not only claim our admiration
because of their beauty, but also because
they carry with them an assurance of
fidelity to nature which no artist's pencil
can inspire.</p>

<p>So singular a combination of ornithologist
and mythologist is the author
of 'Bird Gods' that students of birds,
as well as of myths, will find his pages
of interest. "Why," he asks himself,
"should certain birds have been allotted
to certain gods and goddesses in the
Greek and Roman mythology? Why
should the Eagle go with Zeus, the
Peacock with Hera, the Dove with
Venus, the Swan with Apollo, the Woodpecker
with Ares, the Owl with Pallas
Athené?" And his search for a reply
to these questions has led him into many
little-frequented by-paths of early European
literature, in which he has found
much curious information concerning the
influence of birds on primitive religions.
Impressed by the "share birds have had
in the making of myth, religion, poetry
and legend" he wonders at their wholesale
destruction to-day, and ventures the
hope that "recollection of what our ancestors
thought of birds and beasts, of how
at one time they prized and idealized
them, may induce in us, their descendants,
some shame at the extermination to which
we are consigning these lovable but helpless
creatures, for temporary gains or sheer
brutal love of slaughter."</p>

<p>In a prefatory note the author states
that this book "has been prepared at
the suggestion of the Audubon Society
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">-&#8239;27&#8239;-</a></span>
of the District of Columbia, in the belief
that a local work giving untechnical
descriptions of all birds likely to be seen
in this vicinity, with something of the
haunts and habits of those that nest here,
will be useful to many who desire an
acquaintance with our own birds, but do
not know just how to go about making it."</p>

<p>The book seems admirably adapted to
achieve this end. The opening pages by
Miss Merriam are a capital introduction
to the study of birds in the District of
Columbia. They are followed by 'A
Field Key to Our Common Land Birds,'
and attractively written biographical
sketches of the breeding species. The
migrants and winter residents are treated
more briefly, and an annotated 'List of
All Birds Found in the District of Columbia,'
by Dr. C. W. Richmond, is given.
There are also nominal lists of winter
birds, birds that nest within the city
limits, etc., and an 'Observation Outline,'
abridged from Miss Merriam's
'Birds of Village and Field.'</p>

<p>The book is, in fact, a complete manual
of ornithology for the District of
Columbia, and will undoubtedly prove an
efficient guide to the study of the birds
of that region.</p>

<p>A most practical step in Audubon educational
work is the publication, by the
Massachusetts Audubon Society, of a
chart giving life-size, colored illustrations
of twenty-six of our common birds. On
the whole, both in drawing and coloring,
these birds are excellent, and while a

<p class="center">COPYRIGHTED, 1899, BY FRANK M. CHAPMAN.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<p>During the past six years New York and
Boston publishers have sold over 70,000
text-books on birds, and the ranks of bird
students are constantly growing. With
this phenomenal and steadily increasing
interest in bird-studies, there has arisen
a widespread demand for a popular journal
of ornithology which should be addressed
to observers rather than to collectors
of birds, or, in short, to those who
study "birds through an opera-glass."</p>

<p>The need of such a journal has also
been felt by the Audubon societies, and
in concluding his report for the year
1898, Mr. Witmer Stone, chairman of the
American Ornithologists' Union's Committee
on Bird Protection, remarks on
the necessity of a "magazine devoted to
popular ornithology which could serve as
an organ for the various societies and
keep the members in touch with their
work. All societies which have reached
a membership of several thousand realize
that it is impossible to communicate with
their members more than once or twice a
year, owing to the cost of postage, and
the success of the societies depends
largely upon keeping in communication
with their members."</p>

<p>It is to supply this want of bird students
and bird protectors that <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>
has been established. On its behalf we
promise to spare no effort to make it all
that the most ardent bird student could
desire, and, in the event of our success,
we would appeal to all bird-lovers for
such support as we may be deemed
worthy to receive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We have</span> issued a 'Prospectus,' setting
forth in part the aims of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>, and
as a matter of permanent record, we enter
its substance here. It stated that <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>
would attempt to fill a place in the
journalistic world similar to that occupied
by the works of Burroughs, Torrey, Dr.
van Dyke, Mrs. Miller, and others in the
domain of books. This is a high standard,
but our belief that it will be reached will
doubtless be shared when we announce
that, with one or two exceptions, every
prominent American writer on birds in
nature has promised to contribute to
<span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> during the coming year. The
list of contributors includes the authors
just mentioned, Mabel Osgood Wright,
Annie Trumbull Slosson, Florence A.
Merriam, J. A. Allen, William Brewster,
Henry Nehrling, Ernest Seton Thompson,
Otto Widmann, and numerous other
students of bird-life.</p>

<p>The Audubon Department, under Mrs.
Wright's care, will be a particularly attractive
feature of the magazine, one which,
we trust, is destined to exert a wide influence
in advancing the cause of bird-protection.</p>

<p>The illustrations will consist of half-tone
reproductions of birds and their
nests from nature, and on the basis of
material already in hand, we can assure
our readers that, whether judged separately
or as a whole, this volume of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>
will contain the best photographs of wild
birds which have as yet been published in
this country.</p>

<p>At present <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> will contain from
thirty-two to forty pages, but should our
efforts to produce a magazine on the lines
indicated be appreciated, we trust that the
near future will witness a material increase
in the size of each number.</p>

<p>This department will be devoted especially
to the interests of active Audubon
workers, and we earnestly solicit their
assistance, as our success in making it a
worthy representative of the cause for
which it stands largely depends upon the
heartiness of their co&ouml;peration. Others
also, who are lovers and students of nature
in many forms, but who have never,
for divers reasons, engaged in any bird
protective work, may, through reading of
the systematic and effective methods of
the societies, become convinced of the
necessity of personal action.</p>

<p>We intend at once to establish the
more practical side of the department by
printing in an early issue a bibliography
of Audubon Society publications, in order
that anyone interested may know exactly
what literature has appeared and is available.
For this reason we ask the secretaries
of all the societies to send us a
complete set of their publications, stating,
if possible, the number of each which
has been circulated, and, when for sale,
giving the price at which they may be
obtained.</p>

<p>We also request the secretaries to send
us all possible news of their plans and
work, not merely statistics, but notes of
anything of interest, for even the record
of discouragements, as well as of successes,
may often prove full of suggestion
to workers in the same field, and aid
toward developments that will broaden
and strengthen the entire movement. A
movement in complete harmony with the
great desire of thinking people for a
broader life in nature, which is one of
the most healthful and hopeful features
of the close of this century.</p>

<p class="caption3">Reports of Societies<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The editor acknowledges the receipt from
Mr. Witmer Stone, chairman of the Committee on
Bird Protection of the American Ornithologists'
Union, of a number of the following reports,
which, before the establishment of an official
organ for the Audubon Societies, had been sent
to Mr. Stone for inclusion in his annual report
to the A. O. U., from which, through lack of
space, they were necessarily omitted.</p></div>


<p class="caption3">THE MASSACHUSETTS SOCIETY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Massachusetts Audubon Society</span>
has reissued the Audubon Calendar of
last year and it is having a good sale.
The drawings were made especially for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">-&#8239;30&#8239;-</a></span>
the calendar by a member of the society:
the originals are painted in water colors
on Japanese rice paper, and are very artistic
bird portraits. The same artist is now
at work on drawings of new birds for a
calendar for 1900, which the directors
hope will be reproduced by a more accurate
and satisfactory process.</p>

<p>The Bird Chart of colored drawings of
twenty-six common birds, which the Directors
undertook last spring, is now ready.
The drawings have all been especially
made for the chart by E. Knobel and are
reproduced by the Forbes Lithograph
Manufacturing Co., on twelve stones.
Some of our best ornithologists have seen
the color proof and pronounce it good.
The society has published a descriptive
pamphlet to accompany the chart which
has been prepared by Ralph Hoffmann.
His sketches of the birds are delightfully
written, and the book is valuable in itself.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

News and Reviews</i>.</p></div>

<p>The Directors have recently sent out a
new circular mainly in Boston and vicinity,
which briefly describes the work undertaken
and asks for further co&ouml;peration
from interested persons, and states that
"in addition to our first object, the support
of other measures of importance for
the further protection of our native birds
has been assumed by the Society." Among
such measures may be mentioned:</p>

<p>1. Circulation of literature.</p>

<p>2. Improved legislation in regard to the
killing of birds, and the better enforcement
of present laws.</p>

<p>3. Protection during the season for certain
breeding places of Gulls, Herons and
other birds, which, without such protection
will soon be exterminated.</p>

<p>4. Educational measures. This includes
the publication of colored wall charts of
birds, Audubon Calendars and other helps
to bird study.</p>

<p>The response to this circular has been
gratifying.</p>

<p>The society now numbers over twenty-four
hundred persons, twenty-six of these
are Life Associates, having paid twenty-five
dollars at one time; four hundred and
seventy-five are Associates, paying one
dollar annually; the remaining are Life
Members, having paid twenty-five cents.</p>

<p>While the rage for feather decoration is
unabated, we feel that there is steadily
growing a sentiment among our best people
in condemnation of the custom. There
is a noticeable decrease in the use of
aigrettes and of our native birds, excepting
the Terns and the plumage of the Owl;
and a marked increase in the employment
of the wings and feathers of the barnyard
fowl. While the latter continue to feed the
fashion they are harmless in themselves.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE RHODE ISLAND SOCIETY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Audubon Society</span> of Rhode Island
was organized in October, 1897, and has
now about 350 members.</p>

<p>The purposes of the society, according
to its by-laws, are: the promotion of an
interest in bird-life, the encouragement
of the study of ornithology, and the protection
of wild birds and their eggs.
Some work has been done in the schools,
abstracts of the state laws relating to
birds have been circulated throughout the
state, lectures have been given, and a
traveling library has been purchased for
the use of the branch societies.</p>

<p>Nearly five thousand circulars of various
kinds have been distributed, and it is
evident that the principles of the society
are becoming well known and are exerting
an influence, even in that difficult
branch of Audubon work, the millinery
crusade.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE CONNECTICUT SOCIETY</p>

<p>A score of ladies met in Fairfield on
January 28, 1898, and formed "The Audubon
Society of the State of Connecticut."
Mrs. James Osborne Wright was
chosen president and an executive committee
provisionally elected, representing
so far as possible at the beginning, the
State of Connecticut.</p>

<p>An effort was made to find every school
district in the state, and a Bird-Day programme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">-&#8239;31&#8239;-</a></span>
was sent to 1,350 of these schools.
Care was naturally used to see that the
rural schools, at least, should be reached.
Through the kindness of Congressman Hill
of this district, one of our vice-presidents,
740 copies of Bulletin No. 54, 'Some
Common Birds in their Relation to Agriculture,'
issued by the United States Department
of Agriculture, were received by
the secretary, and 600 of these have been
mailed to individuals.</p>

<p>The Society has had two lectures prepared,
one by Willard G. Van Name, entitled
'Facts About Birds That Concern
the Farmer,' illustrated by sixty colored
lantern slides, and one by Mrs. Mabel Osgood
Wright, on 'The Birds About
Home,' illustrated by seventy colored
slides. A parlor stereopticon has been
purchased for use in projecting the slides.</p>

<p>The lectures and slides are intended
primarily for the use of the local secretaries
of the society, and after these for
such members of the society as desire
to give educational entertainments in the
interest of bird protection.</p>

<p>The only expense connected with the use
of the lectures and slides will be the expressage
from Fairfield to place and return.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances will the outfit
be allowed to go outside of the State of
Connecticut.</p>

<p>The oil lantern accompanying the slides
is suitable for a large parlor or school
room, and can be worked by anyone
understanding the focussing of a photographic
camera, but it is advised that
when the audience is to be composed
of more than fifty people the exhibitor
should secure a regular stereopticon.</p>

<p>Applications should be made at least
two weeks before the outfit is desired.</p>

<p><i>No admission fee is to be charged at
any entertainment at which the outfit is
used</i>, the intention of the Audubon Society
of the State of Connecticut being
to furnish free information about our
birds, and so win many, who may never
have given the matter a thought, to a
sense of the necessity and wisdom of
their protection.</p>

<p>The secretary is glad to report on
January 1, 1899, that the society has had
practical proof of the success of its experiment
in sending out these free illustrated
lectures. Much interest has been
awakened by them, and the State Board
of Agriculture has listed both lectures
for the Farmers' Institutes, held during
the winter months. Much enterprise is
being shown by local secretaries. An
illustrated lecture by Mrs. Kate Tryon,
having been given in Bridgeport, November
19, under the auspices of Miss Grace
Moody (local secretary), Mrs. Howard N.
Knapp, and Mrs. C. K. Averill. While
Mr. Frank M. Chapman lectured before
a large audience at the Stamford High
School, on December 2, under the auspices
of Mrs. Walter M. Smith, the
local secretary of that city.</p>

<p class="caption3">NEW YORK SOCIETY</p>

<p>Since November, 1897, the society has
distributed 13,465 leaflets, making a total
distribution of over 40,000 since its
organization on February 23, 1897.</p>

<p>In spite of this large circulation of
literature, the society has only 529 members,
including 9 patrons, 7 sustaining
members, 356 members, 157 junior members.</p>

<p>Financially, the society is now in a
sound condition.</p>

<p>During the year two public meetings
have been held in the large lecture hall
of the American Museum of Natural History,
at both of which the hall was well
filled. Addresses were made by Dr.
Henry van Dyke, Dr. Heber Newton, and
others.</p>

<p>A 'Bird Talk' was also given by Mr.
W. T. Hornaday, at the house of one of
the honorary vice-presidents, which was
well attended.</p>

<p>In educational work we have secured
the publication of a paper on 'The Relation
of Birds to Trees,' by Florence A.
Merriam, in the annual Arbor Day Manual
of New York State, and Mr. Chapman,
chairman of our Executive Committee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">-&#8239;32&#8239;-</a></span>
reports that in connection with Professor
Bickmore, of the American Museum's
Department of Public Instruction, and a
committee representing the science teachers
of the fourteen normal colleges of the
State, he has prepared a course in bird
study for the normal colleges for the present
year.</p>

<p>Further interest in birds was shown by
the science teachers of the State in their
invitation to Mr. Chapman to address
them on the subject of 'The Educational
Value of Bird Study,' during their
convention, held in New York City, December
29-30, 1898.</p>

<p>That the good work accomplished cannot
be gauged by the number of members
is proved by the constant reports
received from local secretaries and others,
telling of classes formed for bird study,
of clubs that have taken up the subject,
of bird exercises in schools, etc. If all
these silent sympathizers would only
realize how much the cause might be
strengthened by open, concerted action,
shown by a large membership roll of
the Audubon Society, its influence would
be greatly increased.</p>

<p class="caption3">NEW JERSEY SOCIETY</p>

<p>We have at present 124 members
and have distributed over 1,000 general
circulars in regard to the work,
and 1,000 aigrette circulars written by
Mr. Chapman. We expect to have new
literature issued during the coming year,
and are now having the State bird-laws
printed for distribution.</p>

<p class="caption3">DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA</p>

<p>Mrs. John Dewhurst Patten, secretary
of the Audubon Society of the District
of Columbia, reports much valuable
work. A course of six lectures was
given by Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller, and
others by Mr. Chapman and Dr. Palmer.</p>

<p>A successful and fashionably attended
exhibit of millinery was held in April.
Nine of the leading milliners contributed
hats and bonnets, which, of course, were
entirely free from wild bird feathers.
The society has designed an Audubon
pin after a drawing of the Robin, by
Mr. Robert Ridgway. This has already
been adopted by the Pennsylvania
and Massachusetts societies. At
the suggestion of the secretary of the
Pennsylvania society, efforts have been
directed towards the establishment of
societies in the south.</p>

<p>In response to a great demand for a
cheap book of information about local
birds, this society has been instrumental
in issuing 'Birds of Washington and
Vicinity,'<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> by Mrs. L. W. Maynard&mdash;200
pages 12mo, illustrated, which may be
had for the small sum of 85 cents. The
price placing the volume within the
reach of teachers and pupils in the
public schools.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">T</span>urning reluctantly from the attractive little
Chickadee family, described in the preceding
number of this magazine, we will next seek the
acquaintance of a bird of entirely different feather,
and, what is of more moment to the bird photographer,
of entirely different disposition.</p>

<p>The Killdeer Plover, perhaps from his close
kinship to the fraternity of game birds, has come
to regard man and all human devices with deep suspicion, and to
get on terms of close fellowship with him is no easy matter. While
not himself an usual object of the sportsman's effort, owing to his lean
body and indifferent savor, he is the immediate relative of those
much sought-after birds, the Golden and the Black-bellied Plover.
Unlike these more aristocratic members of the Plover group, the
Killdeer does not retire to semi-arctic fastnesses to rear its brood,
but nests wherever found throughout the eastern United States. Its
ever-restless nature and loud alarm, "killdee, killdee," as it moves
from place to place, or circles round and round, always at a safe
distance, together with its common occurrence throughout populated
as well as wild regions, makes this plebeian well-known to every country
lad and the bane of every would-be stealthy Nimrod. So noisily
persistent is its outcry that it has been dubbed by ornithologists
<i>vocifera</i>&mdash;<i>&AElig;gialitis vocifera</i>&mdash;and a most appropriate appellation it is.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 425px;">

<span class="fig_caption">KILLDEER ON NEST</span>
</div>

<p>Like many loquacious people, Mr. and Mrs. Killdeer have a
rather lazy vein in their make-up, and spend but little time or effort
nest building. A little depression lined with a few bits of stick or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">-&#8239;36&#8239;-</a></span>
straw, a few pebbles or other handy materials satisfies their ambition.
In the bare, exposed situation usually chosen, such a nest, with
its four spotted eggs, is much less conspicuous than would be
a well made one. The first of our pictures showed one of these
nests located in a corn-field, which is a not very uncommon
site, although bare pasture knolls and gravelly banks are more
usually selected. The photograph of the nest and eggs was, of
course, easily secured, and is chiefly of interest because it shows
so well how an open nest with its eggs may be protected by blending
perfectly with the general color of the immediate surrounding&mdash;protective
coloration, as it is called. To secure the portrait of the
wary old Killdeer, who left the nest the instant anyone but entered
the large field, seemed a hopeless task. But the novice is ever
ambitious, and the attempt was made in the following fashion, with
what success the accompanying pictures will show. Placing the
camera on the sharply tilted tripod, so that the distance from lens
to nest was about four feet, the dreadful looking object was left in
position for some time on the evening preceding the day on which
the photographs were taken. The next day proved light and clear,
and with the sun well up in the heavens we began operations, my
companion and assistant on this occasion being Rev. H. W.
Gleason, a bird enthusiast undaunted by any obstacle and fertile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">-&#8239;37&#8239;-</a></span>
in devices. Arranging the camera as already described, omitting
the green hood in this instance, as it would have been worse than
useless, we retired entirely from the field, which fortunately lay on
a gently sloping hillside. From our distant retreat we watched,
with field-glass in hand, the maneuvers of the mother bird. The
experience of the preceding evening had evidently helped to prepare
the way, for after only brief delay the anxious bird began running
in a great spiral steadily converging to the central point.
Every clod of earth or little mound in the path was mounted and,
with much craning of neck and turning of head, the dreadful engine
glistening in the sunshine was closely scrutinized from all sides, but
as it was motionless, it probably was regarded as some new-fangled
contrivance for cultivating corn, of finer build than the hoes, rakes,
and other implements left by the men in the field. Once satisfied,
she made a last quick run directly between the legs of the tripod,
and stood erect over her treasures. A long trolling-line, procured at
a neighboring farm-house, had been attached to the lever arm releasing
the shutter, as our seventy-five feet of tubing was not half long
enough. Creeping to the end of the line, a quick pull made the exposure,&mdash;1/25
of a second, with wide open stop and rapid plate.
Pulling up the slack of the line seemed to startle the bird more
than the click of the shutter, and after repeating this procedure
several times we were altogether uncertain as to whether the bird
had been caught at all; and as it was impossible, there in the field,
to follow the advice of an interested farmer spectator, who insisted
that we "ought to look at them there plates and see what we had
before going further," we cast about for some surer method. Carefully
looking over the ground, I found that some seventy-five feet
from the nest there was a shallow depression just deep enough to
entirely conceal a man lying prone on the soft, ploughed ground.
So the rubber tube was substituted for the line and the bulb end
carried up the slope to the little hollow. As it would be impossible
from this position to see the bird, and as we had discovered that a
low whistle or noise caused her to leave the nest at once, some
method of signaling had to be arranged. The trolling line suggested
a way, as we found that it would reach readily from the
bulb in the hollow to the edge of the field. So, attaching one end
of it to my wrist, I took my position flat on the ground in the middle
of the field, with a hot noon sun pouring down overhead, and
awaited the signal,&mdash;a vigorous jerk on the trolling line, to be given
by Mr. Gleason, who from a distance was watching with a glass
the movements of our unwilling sitter. The signal soon came, and
these complicated and rather juvenile tactics proved so successful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">-&#8239;38&#8239;-</a></span>
that very soon Mrs. Plover did not so much as change position at
the click of the shutter, and when driven away to rearrange the
camera between exposures, came quickly back again. In a short
time we had exposed all the plates that seemed necessary, and
retired from the field conquerors, though leaving the foe in peaceful
possession. Returning to the house for supplies for a new
expedition, a lady member of the party, who, from a shady hammock,
had been watching for several hours these rather boyish antics,
saluted us with the withering remark, "About four years of age, I
should think, instead of forty." But we hoped that the end would
justify the means, and were anxious to inspect the developed results.
This part of the work was accomplished a day or two later, and the
pictures here presented show, I think, that our efforts were not
entirely in vain. Several others were not so good. In one, the female
sits quietly on her nest, back to the camera, and in coloration blends
admirably with the surroundings. In another, she is crouching in a
half uncertain attitude, while in still another she stands erect, revealing
the four eggs directly beneath her, and with ruffled plumage
seems a little resentful of the intrusion. In all, it will be noticed
that the bill is partly open, either because it was a very warm day,
because the poor bird was startled and ill at ease, or, it may be,
because it was no easy matter for this always loquacious bird to keep
its mouth shut even when posing for its picture.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">On </span>the morning of May 27, 1897, equipped with an
extra supply of patience and a 5 × 7 'Premo B'
camera fitted with rapid rectilinear lens, my plate-holders
filled with unexposed plates, and accompanied
by my wife, who has been a partner in
all of my successful trips, I started for Otter
Lake, Cayuga County, N. Y.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning, with not a breath
of air stirring (by the way, this is the hardest
of all things to control, and is an absolute necessity if you are to
make fine, clear-cut negatives of birds and their natural surroundings),
and the lake looked like a mirror. It took but a minute to
get the large, flat-bottomed row-boat ready for the start, and we
were soon gliding along, an oar's-length from shore, scanning every
tree, bush, and bunch of rushes, in search of nests, those of the
Red-winged Blackbird being very plenty and placed both in bushes
or rushes in about equal numbers. A pair of Kingbirds had selected
as the place for their summer home, a large, low willow limb which
projected over the water; a peep into the nest revealed three eggs,
common, yet so beautiful in their bed of wool and feathers.</p>

<p>Our next finds were several nests of a pair of Long-billed Marsh
Wrens, which looked more like mouse-nests than anything else I
have in mind. As we could return to these later, if unable to find
anything better, we had not yet exposed a single plate, reserving
them for a rare or unusual find.</p>

<p>We were in search of nests of the Least Bittern, and as we were
passing that part of the shore where they always nested, we soon
located a nest, but as it only contained one egg, another nest must
be found. A male Least Bittern flew up a short distance ahead of
us and 'dropped in' back of the bushes. We rowed down to the
place from which he flushed, and standing up in the boat looked
around, and not more than a boat's-length ahead, we espied a
female sitting on a nest. I pushed the boat very carefully to within
a couple of feet of the nest, and prepared to make an exposure.
The camera was set to focus on an object 34 inches from cap of
lens, and I moved it back and forth until the focus was perfect,
the diaphragm was closed to <i>f</i> 16, and an instantaneous exposure
with speed at 1/25" was made.</p>

<p>As most of my operations, preparatory to making the exposure,
were of necessity carried on within three feet of the bird on the nest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">-&#8239;40&#8239;-</a></span>
she at several times started to leave it; but when the bird moved I
kept still, and when she kept still I worked; in this way I finally
completed my preparations. The peep I got of the eggs as she partly
raised off from them, just as I finished, made me squeeze the bulb
before I intended to; but the result I obtained fully satisfied me, for
in no other way could I describe the results of this trip, and what I
saw and learned of the habits and home-life of the Least Bittern.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">I </span>should like to say a few words to the readers of
<span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> on the subject of making good photographs
of birds. Don't conclude at once, when you
see pictures of nests, or birds in their wild state, that
it is an easy matter to get them. A year ago, when
I saw the fine exhibition of slides presented by Mr.
Brewster and Mr. Chapman at the American Ornithologists'
meeting, I at once concluded that it would
be an easy thing for me to get similar results. So I forthwith
invested much good money in purchasing a camera, and all the
accompanying outfit; but not until I had worried all my photographic
friends for advice of all kinds. With all the confidence
of an expert I started on this unknown sea, and I must confess
to you, patient reader, that my efforts were a brilliant string of failures,
for from the more than one hundred and twenty-five plates that
I exposed, I succeeded in getting only two good negatives. But I
had lots of fun and plenty of experience, and am just as proud of
my two good negatives as the celebrated old hen that had but
one chick. If you want to learn to be patient and persevering,
try photographing in the fields and woods. If you wish to learn
more of the habits of birds than you can in any other possible
way, try for hours to get them familiar enough with you and your
camera to go on with their nest-building, or feeding their nestlings.
Besides all this, in later days, whenever you see the photograph, it
will recall to you every pleasant moment that you spent in getting
the negative.</p>

<p>That you may share with me some of the pleasures that I experienced
in getting a negative of a nest of eggs, from which the accompanying
picture was made, let me tell you the following story about
the Great Northern Diver, more commonly known as the Loon, and
among the scientists as <i>Gavia imber</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">-&#8239;41&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p>Those of you who are familiar with the Adirondack or Canada
lakes can easily picture the surroundings of this nest, which I found
in Higley Lake, Canada. This is a small body of water, hardly
more than a very large pond. This section of Canada maybe
called a lake region, and is very beautiful. Most of the lakes are
surrounded with forests, in which the contrasting colors of the evergreens
and white birches add greatly to the natural beauty of the
scenery. This nest was built in very shallow water, about eight
feet from the shore. It was, at its base, about twenty inches in
diameter, and at its apex about fifteen inches wide. It was about
nine inches above the water at its greatest height, and composed
entirely of mud, so far as I could determine, of a very dark color.
The water where it was placed was not over six or eight inches
deep, but it was really a very hard matter to determine exactly where
the water ended and the mud commenced. This I ascertained to
my sorrow and discomfiture when I undertook to set up my tripod.
Standing in a very round-bottomed boat and trying to plant a tripod
in silt of seemingly unfathomable depth is no easy job, as I found
out. Finally, however, I succeeded in getting what I now have the
pleasure of showing you; but I dare not tell you of the beautiful
failures I made before this picture was obtained. When I first discovered
the nest, the Loon was upon it, but as soon as she saw
me she slid off into the lake and made every effort to dive. It
is true that her head was under the water, but her back was not
until she had gone some feet from the nest out into the lake, where
the water was deep enough to entirely cover her. She did not
then appear until she was well across the pond, where she was
joined by her mate. The nest contained only one egg when I
first saw it; but in the water, on the lake side of the nest, I
found another egg, which the mother bird had evidently rolled out
of the nest, perhaps in her fright and hasty departure when she
first saw me. This egg I replaced in the nest by lifting it with
the broad end of the boat oar, thinking, perhaps, that handling
it might cause the Loon to desert the nest. The egg that
was in the water was many shades lighter in color than the one
found in the nest, which leads me to believe that the eggs of birds
that habitually breed in damp mud nests acquire a darker color
from stains.</p>

<p>In another pond of about the same size, and within half a mile
of Higley Lake, I subsequently saw a pair of Loons that had but
one young, so far as I could ascertain. If there was another it
was kept well hidden. I was very much interested in watching
the methods by which the old birds kept the little fellow out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">-&#8239;42&#8239;-</a></span>
danger. When I first saw the family group, both parents and
the little one were together; but immediately on the appearance
of my boat the whole group disappeared under the surface.
The young bird soon came to the surface again in about the same
spot, but the parents were some distance off on the other side of
the boat, so that I was between them. Both parents were perfectly
quiet until I undertook to row toward their offspring, when
one of the parents uttered what was to me a very new and peculiar
cry, on hearing which the little one immediately dove; the cry
was entirely different from the usual loud, maniacal cry of the Loons.
As soon as the young one appeared I again started toward him,
when the old bird repeated the same cry, and down went the little
fellow. It was very evident that he knew whenever he heard that
warning cry he must disappear at once. I had so much sympathy
for the lonely little chap that I left him, after I had tried the
experiment a number of times. As soon as I drew away to
another part of the pond the old birds uttered the usual well
known cry of the species, but the little one then remained on
the surface and was soon joined by the parent birds.</p>

</div>

<p>A few weeks later the same group acted in an entirely different
manner; then they remained together, and as the boat approached,
the old bird with its bill seemed to push the young one under
the water before it dove itself.</p>

<p>If this bit of the domestic life of these two Loon families has
interested you as much as it did me, I shall feel amply repaid for
the thirty-two miles I had to drive each time I visited them.</p>

<p class="p0">uring the severe cold of January and February,
1895, most of the Bluebirds were thought to
have perished. So it is with the spirit of a
genuine Audubon that we hail their return in ever increasing
numbers each succeeding spring. How sadly
we should miss these little friends may be judged by
the great commotion among ornithologists caused by
their supposed extinction. In order to have more than
a mere remembrance of their habits, I set out one day in the summer
of 1898, at Decorah, Iowa, to obtain photographs of them in their
haunts, and secured two interesting negatives of the female, as shown
in the accompanying illustrations. The history of the case is as follows:
A pair of Bluebirds, after several previous attempts at housekeeping,
and subsequent removals by 'small boys,' at last selected an
old, deserted, Woodpecker's hole in a fence-post, and built, as usual,
a nest of dry grass with a softer lining of horse-hair. The birds had
already begun incubating the three pale blue eggs, which formed the
set, when I disturbed them. I crept within five feet of the post before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">-&#8239;44&#8239;-</a></span>
the female left the nest and joined her mate, who had been keeping
guard in a neighboring plum tree.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 228px;">
<img src="images/pg_44.png" width="228" height="407" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">BLUEBIRD AT NEST</span>
</div>

<p>After focusing my camera to within three feet of the post, and
arranging a string attachment, I concealed myself in some bushes
about seventy-five feet away. I waited patiently for ten minutes
before the female left the
tree and flew down to the
fence. The male followed
close after, and they hopped
about the post and wires,
getting nearer and nearer
the nest, until the female
flew straight into the
hole. A snap-shot, just before
she reached the entrance,
was only partially
successful, but shows very
clearly the pose of the bird's
head and neck while it was
in the air. It was made in
a twenty-fifth of a second
with the lens stopped down
to sixteen. I disturbed the
female several times before
she gained the desired position
at the nest-opening;
but, finally, the snap of
the shutter helped bring to
life one of my best bird-pictures.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the bird's
nesting habits is a prime
requisite in avian photography.
Much patience is
needed, as failures are very
numerous. A camera which may be focused to within two or three
feet is an absolute necessity in order to make the picture large
enough. Most of my failures have been caused by the lack of
bright sunlight, under-exposure, or movement of the bird the
instant the picture was taken; but one good photograph is sufficient
reward for many trials.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">The </span>cold wave reached us at Miami, on Biscayne Bay,
Florida, in the night of February 12, 1899. It was
preceded by severe thunder storms in the evening.
On the 13th, Monday, it was very cold all over the
state, with snow and sleet as far south as Ormond
and Titusville. Our thermometers at Miami ranged
from 36° to 40° during the day. As I sat in my
room at the hotel, about four in the afternoon, I saw
a bird outside my window, then another and another,
and soon the air seemed full of wings.</p>

<p>Opening my window to see what the visitors could be, I found
they were Tree Swallows (<i>Tachycineta bicolor</i>). Several flew into
my room, others clustered on the window ledge, huddling closely
together for warmth. There were hundreds of them about the house
seeking shelter and warmth. They crept in behind the window
blinds, came into open windows, huddled together by dozens on
cornices and sills. They were quite fearless; once I held my hand
outside and two of them lighted on its palm and sat there quietly.
As it grew dark and colder their numbers increased. They flew
about the halls and perched in corners, and the whole house was
alive with them. Few of the guests in the hotel knew what they
were; some even called them 'bats,' and were afraid they might
fly into their faces or become entangled in their hair. One man
informed those about him that they were Humming Birds, 'the
large kind, you know,' but all were full of sympathy for the beautiful
little creatures, out in the cold and darkness. A few were
taken indoors and sheltered through the night, but 'what were
these among so many?'</p>

<p>The next morning the sun shone brightly though the weather
was still very cold&mdash;the mercury had fallen below 30° during the
night. But as I raised the shade of one of my eastern windows I
saw a half-dozen of the Swallows sitting upon the ledge in the sunshine,
while the air seemed again filled with flashing wings. I was
so relieved and glad. Surely the tiny creatures, with their tints of
steely blue or shining green contrasting with the pure white of the
under parts, were more hardy than I had feared. But alas! it was
but a remnant that escaped. Hundreds were found dead. Men were
sent out with baskets to gather the limp little bodies from piazzas,
window ledges, and copings. It was a pitiful sight for St. Valentine
Day, when, as the old song has it,</p>

<p class="p0">loud Cap Inn, the
loghouse hotel fastened
down with cables high
on the north side of Mount
Hood, is too near timber-line
to claim a great variety of
feathered guests, but Oregon
Jays and Clark's Crows or
Nutcrackers are regular pensioners
of the house. The
usual shooting by tourists
does not menace them, for the
nature-loving mountaineers, who keep the Inn and act as guides to
the summit, guard most loyally both birds and beasts. They like to
tell of a noble Eagle which used to fly up the cañon and circle over
the glacier every day, and they recall with pleasure the snowy morning
when an old Blue Grouse brought her brood to the Inn, and the birds
ate the wheat that was thrown them with the confidence of chickens.
The Grouse were, apparently, regular neighbors of the Inn, and
while there I had the pleasure of seeing a grown family. They fed
on the slope close above me with the unconcern of domestic fowls,
conversing in turkey-like monosyllables as they moved about, and
two of them came within a few feet and looked up at me&mdash;that not
forty rods from the Inn! The pleasure of the sight was doubled by
the reflection that such things
could be so near a hotel,
even on a remote mountain.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">CLOUD CAP INN</span>
</div>

<p>It was delightful to see
how familiarly birds gathered
about the house. You could
sit in the front doorway and
when not absorbed in looking
off on the three wonderful
snow peaks&mdash;St. Helens,
Rainier, and Adams&mdash;rising
above the Cascade range,
could watch Oregon Juncos,
Steller's Jays, Oregon Jays, and Nutcrackers coming down to drink
at the hydrant twenty feet away; while the Ruby Kinglet and White-crowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">-&#8239;47&#8239;-</a></span>
Sparrow, together with Townsend's Solitaire and other interesting
westerners, moved about in the branches of the low timber-line
pines; and Lewis' Woodpeckers, with their long, powerful flights,
crossed over the forested cañons below. Crossbills had stayed around
the house sociably for three weeks together, Mrs. Langille, the noble
old mother of the mountaineers, told me. She said they would fly
against the logs of the house and call till she went out to feed them.
They left with the first heavy storms, though usually, she said:
"That's the time when we have birds come around the house&mdash;when
there are storms." And a friendly hospice the feathered wayfarers
find it so long as the Inn is open!</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 226px;">
<img src="images/pg_47.png" width="226" height="162" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">CLARK'S CROW</span>
</div>

<p>The Oregon Jays and Clark's Crows are, as I said, the regular
pensioners of the house. The Jays look very much like their relatives
the Canada Jays, but are darker, and when you are close to
them the feathers of their
backs show distinct whitish
shaft-streaks. The Crows
have the general form and
bearing of Crows, but are
black only on wings and tail,
their general appearance being
gray. Speaking of the
birds, Mrs. Langille said: "If
I was in the kitchen myself
I'd have them come right to
the porch outside; when I'm
in the kitchen I'm always
throwing out crumbs for the birds and squirrels, and I've had the
Jays come and sit right down on the block where I was cutting
meat and take the fat right out of my hands." Clark's Crows, she
said, would not eat from her hand, but would sit on the back porch
and call for their breakfast.</p>

<p>When I was at the Inn, the Chinese cook used to throw scraps
from the table over a lava cliff, and both Crows and Jays spent
most of their time carrying it off. As the foot of the cliff was one
of the best places to watch them, I spent part of every day there,
and when the smell of coffee grounds got too strong, consoled myself
by looking through the trees up at the grand white peak of
Hood.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see the difference in the ways of the two
birds. The Nutcracker would fly down to the rocks with rattling
wings, and, when not too hungry to be critical, would proceed to
investigate the breakfast with the air of a judge on the bench, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">-&#8239;48&#8239;-</a></span>
he is a dignified character. To touch the hem of his robe to the
food would have been defilement, so he went about pressing his
wings tight to his sides, sometimes giving them a little nervous
shake. To smile at this sober-minded person seems most disrespectful,
but the solemnity of his gambols was surely provocative of
mirth. Not content with turning his long-billed head judicially from
side to side as he advanced through the scraps, if the biscuit on his
left was not to his mind, with one great ungainly leap he would box
half the compass and plant his big feet before a potato on his right.
This he would proceed to probe with a grave air of interrogation,
and if he decided the case in the negative would withdraw his beak
and pass to the next case on the docket. Once when the potato
was half a waffle, he pried it up tentatively with his long bill, and at
last, deciding in its favor, proceeded to fly off with it, his long legs
dangling ludicrously behind him.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">OREGON JAY</span>
</div>

<p>The Oregon Jays were quite unlike their Crow cousins. They
would come flying in, talking together in sociable fashion, and drop
down so noiselessly you could but be struck by the difference
between fluffy owl-like feathers and stiff quills. Sometimes one of
the Jays would touch the side of a tree a moment before dropping
lightly to the ground. All their motions were quick and easy, if
not actually graceful, and they worked rapidly, with none of the profound
deliberation shown at times by the Nutcracker. The smaller
pieces of food they ate; the larger ones they carried off, usually in
their bills, occasionally in their claws. In eating, the Jay would
sometimes adopt the Blue Jay
style and put his food under his
foot, where he could pull it
apart, throwing up his head to
swallow. When the food was
soft and too large to swallow at
one gulp, both Crows and Jays
would carry it to an evergreen,
lay it down on a twig before
them, and there eat comfortably,
as from a plate. Both birds often
flew to the ledges of the cliff for
food that had lodged there in
falling, and it made a busy scene when eight or ten of the big fellows
were flying about the place at once.</p>

</div>

<div class="dropcap">A</div>
<p class="p0">Bird-Day exercise, in order to have much value
educationally, should be largely the result of the
pupils' previous work, and should not be the mere
repetition of a prepared program, taken verbatim from
some leaflet or paper. The program should be prepared
by the pupils, under the direction of the teacher, and should
contain as many original compositions or statements about
birds, derived from personal observation, as possible.</p>

<p>Bird-Day should be announced some weeks beforehand, in order
to give the children time to prepare for it. In the meantime, direct
them to observe the birds, and allow from five to ten minutes each
morning to receive the reports. Direct that crumbs be scattered in
the back yards, and cups containing seeds be put up in the trees, or
on the fences, and that bones from the table be fastened where they
can be seen from the windows. Then, with an opera glass, if one
can be obtained, results are to be looked for.</p>

<p>For directing the young observer, write upon the board a scheme
like this:</p>

<div class="blckqt">

<p class="caption4">ENGLISH SPARROW</p>

<p>Length from tip of beak to end of tail?</p>
<p>What is the shape, color, and size of beak?</p>
<p>What is the color of legs and feet?</p>
<p>How many toes? Which way do they point?</p>
<p>Gait upon the ground,&mdash;does it walk, hop or run?</p>
<p>Color of head and throat? Color of under parts?</p>
<p>Color and marking of back?</p>
<p>Difference in markings of male and female?</p>
<p>Describe actions which indicate its character.</p>
<p>Is it pugnacious? Is it brave? Is it selfish?</p>
<p>Does it trouble other birds?</p>

<p>Describe its voice or song. Does it utter notes indicating diverse feelings, as
joy, anger? What syllables best recall some of its notes?</p>

</div>

<p>For the younger pupils a few of these questions, perhaps two or
three, will be sufficient for one exercise. Children will vary, and
often contradict one another in answering the same questions. Dwell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">-&#8239;50&#8239;-</a></span>
upon each question till it is answered correctly, and all agree upon
the answer.</p>

<p>A similar plan may be followed for studying the Robin, Bluebird,
Catbird, Oriole, or other birds as they arrive, or as they become
accessible to certain of the pupils. In April, two years ago, one little
girl had observed, and described accurately, seventeen different species
of birds which she had seen in the little yard of her home. They had
been attracted by the food she had put out for them.</p>

<p>The nest-building of birds is also a good subject for observation,
the Robin being, perhaps, the best species for a first study.</p>

<div class="blckqt">
<p class="caption4">QUESTIONS ON NEST-BUILDING AND NESTING HABITS</p>

<p>Which bird does most building, the male, or the female?</p>
<p>Do both carry material?</p>
<p>Does the male ever seem to be acting as escort or guard to his mate?</p>
<p>What materials are used? What is the appearance of the nest? Its situation&mdash;sheltered
or not?</p>

<p>After the nest is completed, watch it till the young are hatched. Which bird
sits upon the eggs? Does the male ever relieve his mate at this task? Does he bring
food to her? Does he spend some time singing to her, as if he were trying to keep
her cheerful? Does he protect her from attack by birds or other enemies?</p>

<p class="caption4">SOME QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED ABOUT ROBINS</p>

<p>Learn to distinguish the voices and call notes of the male and female. Which
bird wakes first in the morning and calls the other? You may also notice, sometimes,
in the night, that one bird wakes and calls the other. Which one generally wakes
first at these times?</p>

<p>Do Robins raise more than one brood in a season? If so, do they use the same
nest twice? If they raise two broods, what becomes of the first, while the mother
is sitting upon the eggs for the second?</p>

<p>Watch for a Robin leading out a family of chicks. Notice the feeding after the
birds are old enough to run and fly fairly well. The young birds are placed apart
by the parent, who visits each one in turn, and rebukes any who tries to be piggish,
sometimes nipping it with its bill when it runs up out of turn. Notice this parent
teaching the young to sing,&mdash;it is a very interesting sight.</p>

</div>

<p>The teacher will need some good manual to aid in identifying
some of the species, though much of the work the first season
would better be upon common, well-known birds. The following are
recommended:</p>

<p>'Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America,' by Frank M.
Chapman, published by D. Appleton &amp; Co.; 'Bird-Craft,' by Mabel
Osgood Wright, published by The Macmillan Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">-&#8239;51&#8239;-</a></span></p>


<p class="caption2">FOR BIRD-DAY PROGRAMS</p>

<p>For the first Bird-Day in every school it would be well to have
some one read Senator Hoar's petition of the birds to the Legislature
of Massachusetts. This remarkable paper deserves reading by all
friends of birds at least once a year.</p>

<div class="blckqt">

<p><i>Compositions.</i>&mdash;Have also original compositions, describing some bird studied,
or describing some of its habits, especially its habit of feeding, and the actions
showing its disposition.</p>

<p><i>Personations.</i>&mdash;Special interest will be awakened by having 'personations' of
birds. These are descriptions of birds told in the first person, as if the bird itself
were telling its own story. An accurate account of the bird's appearance, habits,
feelings, and life from the bird's view-point, is given, but without telling the bird's
name. At the close of the reading, the hearers vote upon the name of the bird
'personated.'</p>

<p><i>Audubon Society Literature.</i>&mdash;The teacher should also obtain circulars from the
secretaries of the New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and other Audubon
Societies. These will give information concerning the rapid destruction of birds.
Extracts may be read from them.</p>

<p><i>Poems.</i>&mdash;Extracts from the poets naturally form an interesting feature of Bird-Day.
Poets are generally bird-lovers and bird-seers. Among the poems peculiarly
adapted are the following:</p>

<p>'Robert O'Lincoln,' Bryant; 'The Mocking Bird,' Sidney Lanier; 'The Sky
Lark,' Shelly; 'The O'Lincoln Family,' Wilson Flagg; 'The Rain Song of the Robin,'
Kate Upson Clark; 'The Titmouse,' R. W. Emerson; 'The Eagle,' Tennyson; 'To
The Skylark,' William Wordsworth.</p>

<p><i>Personal Experiences.</i>&mdash;Another pleasant part of the program will be the short
statements of facts about birds, by the pupils, obtained from their own observation.
Birds of the Bible may also be given in short extracts.</p>

<p><i>Prose Selections.</i>&mdash;John Burroughs' 'Birds and Poets,' and 'Wake Robin;' Bradford
Torrey's 'Birds in the Bush;' Olive Thorne Miller's 'Bird Ways,' and many
other books, abound in suitable passages for Bird-Day.</p>

</div>

<p>The pupils will enjoy preparing a Bird-Day program much more
than learning little set speeches from one already prepared. The
preliminary observation of birds will arouse an enthusiasm that will
be of great value in all educational work.</p>

<div class="dropcap">B</div>
<p class="p0">irthdays, red letter days, memorial days,
arbor days and bird days!</p>

<p>The two hundred days of the school calendar
are hardly sufficient to meet the special
demands made upon them in the interests of history,
literature, and philanthropy. After all, is not this call for
specialization something of a reproach to both home and
school? If the child is symmetrically developed, harmoniously
educated, will not all these influences find their proper place and
expression in his life in the <i>regular</i> course of events?</p>

<p>But in the meantime since 'days' are ordained, it is highly important
that they shall be celebrated in a manner to make lasting
impressions on the minds and hearts of children. The mental
hysteria resulting from the spasmodic, sentimental fervor worked
up for this cause to-day, and for that to-morrow, is to be strongly
condemned.</p>

<p>As in every other subject, an interest in <i>birds</i> should be based
upon the knowledge gained by the child primarily through his own
observations and experiences, supplemented and enriched later by
what he reads or has told him. The interest thus aroused leads to
sympathy and love as enduring as life itself.</p>

<p>Hence the Bird-Day program should mark the culminating rather
than the initial point of bird study for the year.</p>

<p>The children should be led to anticipate it, and should be
prepared for it in as many ways and for as long a time as possible.
All that nature lovers have written or poets sung will have
deeper significance after the child's contact with the birds of his
neighborhood, as seen in parks, woods, or fields. To see their pictures
is not enough. Field work alone can give the stimulus which
leads to fellowship, sympathy, love, and protection.</p>

<p>For young children especially, interest is most readily aroused
through the study of the <i>activities</i> which ally bird and child. The
character and the adaptation of birds' clothing, foods and homes to
their peculiar needs and environment; glimpses of nest-life; characteristic
traits; disposition; the cleverness of the parent birds in
outwitting enemies and protecting the young; the skillful uses of
tools&mdash;bills and claws&mdash;are all readily appreciated by the children.
Add to these, studies in protective coloration, migration, the relation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">-&#8239;53&#8239;-</a></span>
of birds to insects injurious to vegetation, and kindred subjects,
which form a never-failing source of delight. Through such work,
the child learns almost unwittingly much of bird structure, classification,
and description which would otherwise prove dry and barren of
interest.</p>

<p>The boy who thus comes into fellowship with birds will not
delight in beanshooters or find his chief joy in robbing birds' nests
and violating game laws; while his sister will try to find something
more ornamental for her hat than slaughtered birds.</p>


<p class="caption3"><i>THE PROGRAM</i></p>

<p>While programs must vary according to the needs and ability of
the children, a few suggestions may be helpful to all.</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="caption3">DECORATION</p>

<p>'Sharp Eyes,' and 'I Spy,' by William Hamilton Gibson, 'Nature's Hallelujah,'
and 'The Message of the Bluebird,' by Irene Jerome, are full of delightfully suggestive
and artistic bits of bird-life for black-board pictures.</p>

<p>A pretty corner may be made by a small bush or the branch of a large tree
in which the nests collected by the children are appropriately placed.</p>

<p>Pictures of bird-lovers and writers should be in evidence. Audubon, Wilson,
John Burroughs, Bradford Torrey, Olive Thorne Miller, and others. Many of these
may be found in recent magazines.</p>

<p>Anecdotes and short sketches from their books may be told or read.</p>


<p class="caption3">COMPOSITIONS</p>

<p>Compositions prepared in advance, on various phases of bird-life, may be read
by their young authors. These may be the result of work previously done in class
along the lines before mentioned, or of new observations and experiences gathered
for Bird-Day. The greater the variety of topics, the better.</p>

<p>Descriptions of individual birds, comparisons of birds, individually or by classes,
as to:</p>

<p><i>Food.</i>&mdash;Character; where, when, and how obtained.</p>

<p><i>Home.</i>&mdash;Location; materials; construction; appearance.</p>

<p><i>Young.</i>&mdash;Number; appearance; care and education.</p>

<p><i>Songs and Calls.</i>&mdash;Emotions expressed; character, short or sustained, high or
low, sweet or harsh, etc.</p>

<p><i>Relations.</i>&mdash;Names of other birds of same class.</p>

<p><i>Bird Craftsmen.</i>&mdash;Masons, miners, weavers, tailors, etc.</p>

<p><i>Tree-top Neighbors.</i>&mdash;Spring, summer, fall and winter.</p>

<p><i>How Birds Travel.</i></p>

<p><i>How Birds Help the Farmers.</i></p>

<p><i>Invitations to the Birds.</i>&mdash;Boxes put up for them; seed-cups, bits of suet nailed
to posts or trees.</p>

<p>A great many years ago a little boy, whom I knew very well,
accepted the advice of an elder, and went out with a salt-cellar
to make friends with the birds. But they would not have him,
even with a 'grain of salt,' and it was not until he was considerably
older that he learned he had begun his study of birds at the wrong
end. That is, you know, the wrong end of the bird, for it is not a
bird's tail, but his bill, you must attend to if you would win his confidence
and friendship.</p>

<p>So, instead of salt, use bread-crumbs, seeds, and other food, and
some day you may have an experience which will surprise those people
who would think it a very good joke indeed to send you out with a
salt-cellar after birds. I have recently had an experience of this kind.
It happened in the heart of a great city, surely the last place in the
world where one would expect to find any birds, except House Sparrows.
But Central Park, New York City, the place I refer to, contains
several retired nooks where birds are often abundant. A place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">-&#8239;56&#8239;-</a></span>
known as the 'Ramble' is a particularly good one for birds, and during
the past winter, when it was not too cold, I have often gone from
my study in the near-by Museum of Natural History to eat my luncheon
with the birds in the Ramble. Many other bird-lovers have also
visited the Park to study and feed the birds, and, as always happens
when birds learn that they will not be harmed, they have become
remarkably tame.</p>

<span class="smaller">Photographed from nature, by F. M. Chapman.</span></span>
</div>

<p>This is especially true of the Chickadees, who, under any circumstances,
seem to have less fear of man than most birds. When I
entered the Ramble they soon responded to an imitation of their
plaintive call of two high, clearly whistled notes. And in a short time
we became such good friends that I had only to hold out my hand
with a nut in it to have one of them at once perch on a finger, look
at me for a moment with an inquiring expression in his bright little
eyes, then take the nut and fly off to a neighboring limb, where,
holding it beneath his toes, he would hammer away at it with his
bill, Blue Jay fashion.</p>

<p>One day I induced one of them to pose before my camera, and,
as a result, I now have the pleasure of presenting you with his
portrait, as an actual proof that nuts are much more effective than
salt, in catching birds. So, after this, we won't go out with salt-cellars,
but with a supply of food; nor should we forget to take
a "pocketful of patience," which, Mrs. Wright says, is the salt of
the bird-catching legend.</p>

<div class="dropcap">W</div>
<p class="p0">e have been delighted with the interest aroused by our
request for descriptions of February walks, and in imagination
have enjoyed outings throughout a large part of the
United States with our little correspondents.</p>

<p>We have found ourselves obliged to give two prizes, one of
which goes to Mildred A. Robinson, of Waltham, Massachusetts,
whose <a href="#A_February_Walk_Prize_Essay">essay</a> will appear in our next number; the other to Floyd C.
Noble, of New York City, whose description of a <a href="#A_February_Walk_in_Central_Park_New_York">walk in Central
Park</a> appears in this issue of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>.</p>

<p>Much to his surprise, the Editor found that he was competing
for the prize he himself had offered! He had written an account
of some Central Park birds for this department before Master Noble's
article was received, and is obliged to confess that Master Noble mentions
several species which he had not observed. He, therefore,
presents only that part of his manuscript relating to the Chickadee,
and leaves Master Noble to tell of the other birds in the Park.</p>

<p>The selection of the winning essays was made with much difficulty,
and, in addition to the two chosen, we would especially commend
those written by the following named boys and girls:</p>

<p>On February 18, 1899, my friend and I started out
'bird-hunting,' as usual, in the 'Ramble,' Central
Park. It was during the comparatively warm spell
after the blizzard of the 12th, and the preceding zero
weather. On the way we saw a Starling, perched high
on a building, trying to sing. On entering the Park we
saw a White-throated Sparrow. I have seen this species
more times than any other this month&mdash;of course, excepting
the common Sparrow.</p>

<p>On nearing our 'hunting-grounds,' we heard the familiar '<i>cree-e</i>'
of a Brown Creeper, and soon discovered the little fellow hard at
work, as usual. A little later we came upon the beautiful Cardinal,
with his two wives. It is a fact that there are one male and two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">-&#8239;58&#8239;-</a></span>
females, though probably only one is his real mate. He does not,
however, appear to be partial to either.</p>

<p>Further on we found what we were chiefly looking for&mdash;a flock
of lively little Chickadees. I found that I had only a very small
supply of hazelnuts with me, but I made the best of them. There
was a good deal of snow on the ground, which made the Chickadees
unusually tame&mdash;being hungry. They would light on our hands,
inspect the pieces of crushed nut there, knock off the ones that did
not suit them, and finally fly off with one&mdash;usually the largest. We
soon began to recognize separate birds, and gave them names: such
as 'Buffy,' 'Pretty,' etc. Then our attention was attracted by the
queer noise made by the Nuthatch, and this trunk-crawling friend of
ours appeared. We think that continued close inspection of tree-trunks
has made him near-sighted, because when you throw him a
piece of nut he generally just gazes at it, grunts a little, and then
looks at you again. My cousin suggested that when he did find
what you threw him, it was by the sense of hearing rather than that
of sight, as he can generally find a big piece that makes a noise in
falling. When he succeeds in getting 'something good,' he wedges
it into the bark somewhere and hits it with his bill.</p>

<p>But, between the Nuthatch, the Chickadees, and the hungry
squirrels&mdash;that would sit up with their paws on their breasts, and
their heads on one side, imploring for food, it is needless to say
successfully,&mdash;our small supply of nuts was soon gone. So we went
home as fast as we could, procured more nuts, and in twenty minutes
were again in the 'hunting grounds.' But we found, to our
dismay, that others had monopolized our flock of chickadees! However,
what partly compensated for this, was a good close view of a
Downy Woodpecker. There is a pair of these birds around here,
which you are almost sure to see,&mdash;either together or singly.</p>

<p>But it was soon time to go home, and on the way we heard
the lively song of the European Goldfinches, and soon found four of
them high up in a tree. They are shy birds, and flew as we
approached. They feed on pine cones, and a flock of them will take
possession of a pine tree, hide themselves in the dark tufts of pine
needles, and eat the seeds at their leisure. The only way you can
have knowledge of their presence is by the frequent cracking of the
seeds heard. For a long time we thought they were Crossbills, but
one day a flock of noisy Sparrows came into the tree and drove the
quiet Goldfinches out of their tufts&mdash;much to my surprise, for I did
not suppose that Goldfinches, which I had been accustomed to find
singing loudly, could keep so quiet. We also saw a Song Sparrow
quietly picking away at some bird-seed scattered there.</p>

<p class="caption3">Sparrow Proof Houses</p>

<p>Mr. D. R. Geery, of Greenwich, Conn.,
sends us descriptions of the two bird-houses
here figured. When designed for
Bluebirds, they should be suspended from
a limb ten or twelve feet from the ground,
in such a manner as to allow them to
swing slightly. Mr. Geery writes: "It
may happen that the Sparrows will go to
these houses and even commence to build,
but, as soon as they find that they swing
and are not firm, they will abandon them
entirely. Wren boxes should be stationary,
with an opening not much larger than
a twenty-five-cent piece, and placed so as
to be well shaded most of the day."</p>

<p class="caption3">A Musical Woodpecker</p>

<p>In the pursuit of my profession I had
occasion for some time to travel over a
certain road, along which is a telephone
line, the glass insulators of which are
placed on short pieces of hard wood which
are nailed directly to the post.</p>

<p>Probably half a dozen times, when on
this road, I saw a male Downy Woodpecker
perched directly beneath the hard wood
block, pecking at it in a manner to make
the wire ring, then pausing and evidently
listening to the music it had produced.</p>

<p>When the vibration ceased the performance
was repeated and continued at
intervals until I was obliged to drive by
and frighten the bird away.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. D. L.

<p class="caption3">An Ornithologist at San Juan</p>

<p>An English newspaper correspondent,
who called at the American Museum of
Natural History to identify certain birds
which he had seen in Cuba, gave an interesting
illustration of how, under the
most adverse circumstances, an enthusiastic
naturalist may exercise his powers of
observation. He said, "I noticed at San
Juan a bird which seemed to be much
alarmed by the firing. He hopped from
the bushes to the lower branches of trees,
and then, limb by limb, reached the tree
tops," and continued with a readily identifiable
description of the singular Cuban
Cuckoo, locally known as Arriero (<i>Saurothera
merlini</i>).</p>

<p>There is one bird in Cuba, the Turkey
Buzzard or Vulture, of which many of our
soldiers probably retain a too vivid recollection,
but how many of the men who
were at San Juan can recall any other bird
observed during the day of battle?</p>

<p>Although more books have been written
about British birds than on the birds of
any other region, and although Dr. Sharpe
has written more bird books than any
other living ornithologist, this we believe
is the first treatise he has produced on the
birds of his native land. He explains that
the text is only a "running commentary"
on the pictures, but claims that his
"Systematic Index" is "the most complete
record of the birds in the 'British
List' yet published." It enumerates 445
species of birds which, according to Dr.
Sharpe, have been recorded from Great
Britain. In his 'Introduction' he classifies
these according to the manner of
their occurrence, as follows: Species
which have probably escaped from confinement,
14; Indigenous species, 138;
Visitors from the South&mdash;regular, 70,
occasional or accidental, 69; Visitors from
the East&mdash;regular, 5, accidental or occasional,
38; Visitors from the North&mdash;regular,
35, occasional or accidental, 29;
Visitors from the West&mdash;regular 1, occasional,
43. The latter are all American
species, and the number recorded indicates
how much more frequently our birds are
found on the other side of the Atlantic
than European birds are observed here.</p>

<p>The illustrations consist of colored
vignettes in the text of nearly every
species. They are not above criticism,
but, on the whole, are excellent and form
a far more certain and convenient aid to
identification than the most detailed description
or elaborate key. In many
cases even American species of accidental
occurrence are figured, and, in this connection,
we are tempted to ask why
British authors cannot use for our birds
the names by which they are known in
this country? Who would recognize the
Rusty Blackbird under the name of the
"Rusty Black Hang-Nest," a misnomer
in every sense of the word, or our Robin
as the "American Thrush," to cite two
among numerous examples.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly gratifying to find the
American Ornithologists' Union, as represented
by Mr. Witmer Stone, the Chairman
of its Committee on Bird Protection,
taking so strong a stand on the question
of egg-collecting. In his annual report to
the Union (The Auk, XVI, January, 1899,
p. 61), Mr. Stone says, "Egg-collecting has
become a fad which is encouraged and
fostered by the dealers until it is one of
the most potent causes of the decrease in
our birds. The vast majority of egg-collectors
contribute nothing to the science
of ornithology, and the issuing of licenses
promiscuously to this class makes any law
for bird protection practically useless.</p>

<p>"Too often boys regard the formation
of a <i>large</i> collection of eggs or birds
as necessarily the first step towards becoming
an ornithologist of note; but if
those who have already won their spurs
will take the trouble to point out to the
beginners the lines of work which yield
results of real benefit to science, they will
be led to see exactly how much collecting
and what sort of specimens are really
needed for scientific research, and not
needlessly duplicate what has already
been procured. Further, they will in all
probability become known as original contributors
to ornithological science, while
as mere collectors they would bid fair to
remain in obscurity."</p>

<p>Mr. Stone's report is of the utmost
interest to all workers for the better protection
of our birds. We have not space
to notice it further here, but it may be
obtained by addressing him at the Academy
of Natural Science, Philadelphia,
Pa., and enclosing six cents in stamps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">-&#8239;62&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p>Two ornithological organizations established,
in January, magazines for the publications
of their proceedings and papers
relating to the avifauna of their respective
states. The first, the 'Journal of the
Maine Ornithological Society,' an octavo
quarterly, is edited by C. H. Morrill, at
Pittsfield, Maine; the publisher and
business manager being O. W. Knight,
of Bangor, Maine. The second, the 'Bulletin
of the Cooper Ornithological Club,'
is edited by Chester Barlow, of Santa
Clara, California, with the assistance of
Henry Reed Taylor and Howard Robertson.
The business managers are Donald
Cohen, of Alameda, and A. I. McCormick,
of Los Angeles, California. Both journals
are the outgrowth of a demand on
the part of the societies they represent
for an official organ, and they will undoubtedly
exert a stimulating influence
on the study of birds in the states in
which they are published.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have also to acknowledge the receipt
of the initial number of a third new periodical,
'Nature Study in Schools,' conducted
by the well-known naturalist, C. J.
Maynard, at West Newton, Mass. It
is an illustrated monthly of 26 pages,
containing papers interesting alike to
teachers and students, and should prove
very helpful in its chosen field.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Company</span> have in
press a bird-book for children by Mrs.
Olive Thorne Miller, to be entitled 'The
First Book of Birds.' As its name indicates,
it will aim to introduce its readers to
the study of birds by taking them from the
nest through all the ordinary phases of a
bird's existence, and including chapters on
structure, economics, directions for study,
etc. The book will be illustrated, and its
author's experience as a student and
teacher of birds is an assurance that it
will be a valuable addition to ornithological
literature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Few nature books not designed to assist
in identification of species have met
with the sale that has been accorded
Ernest Seton Thompson's 'Wild Animals
I Have Known' (Charles Scribner's
Sons). Published late in October, it
went rapidly through several editions,
and by January 1, or little more than
two months after its appearance, 7,000
copies had been disposed of.</p>

<p>The reason for this phenomenal success
is not hard to find; it appears on
every page of the book, the text, illustrations,
and make-up of which are
equally pleasing.</p>

<p>Mr. Thompson goes a step further
than most students of animals in nature.
He does not present us with the biography
of the species, but with its personal
history, and his minute knowledge of
and close sympathy with his subjects
leads to his writing a singular charm.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Josephine A. Clark</span>, of 1322 Twelfth
street, N. W., Washington, D. C., publishes
a useful 'Bird Tablet for Field
Use.' It is abridged from the 'Outline

'Birds of Village and Field,' and may be
obtained from the publisher for the sum
of twenty-five cents.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C. A. Babcock</span>, well-known as the

a book entitled 'Bird-Day and How to Prepare

<p><a id="Editorial_a"></a>The establishment of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> has
brought its editor in touch with many previously
unknown friends, who, with the
utmost kindness, have expressed their
approval of the new publication and predicted
for it a successful career. To
thank all our correspondents individually
has been out of the question, and we take
this means, therefore, to assure them of
our appreciation of their good wishes.</p>

<p>Doubtless they will be interested to
know that within two weeks after the publication
of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>, the publishers had
disposed of more copies than it was supposed
they would sell in two months,
while the demand for specimen copies was
so large, that at the end of the same period
our edition of 6,000 was nearly exhausted
and we were obliged to issue a notice to
the effect that the remaining copies would
be delivered only to subscribers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Lacey-Hoar Bird Bill has met with
a greatly to be regretted fate. With
earnest advocates of bird protection in
both the House and Senate, and with sufficient
support to ensure the passage of any
desirable measure, the prospects of securing
needed legislation seemed to be excellent.
Doubtless both Congressman
Lacey's and Senator Hoar's bills would
have passed if they had been presented
separately, but making the latter an
amendment to the former, created a series
of contradictions that apparently could
not be adjusted in conference, and, as a
result, measures the intent of which the
majority of both houses evidently favored,
failed to become laws.</p>

<p>However, the terms of neither Mr. Hoar
nor Mr. Lacey have expired, and it is to
be hoped that before the next Congress
convenes they will have prepared a bill in
which their interests in birds will be harmoniously
presented.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One of the most dangerous enemies
threatening our birds to-day is the man
who, under the mask of 'science,' collects
birds and their eggs in wholly unwarranted
numbers. He is dangerous
not alone because of the actual destruction
of life he causes, but because his excesses
have brought into disrepute the work of
the collector who, animated by the spirit
of true science, and appreciating the
value of life, takes only those specimens
which he needs to assist him in his studies.</p>

<p>For this reason we feel it to be our duty
to publicly protest against such wholly
inexcusable nest-robbing as Mr. L. W.
Brownell, of Nyack, N. Y. confesses
himself to be guilty of in the January
issue of 'The Osprey.' In describing a
visit to Pelican Island, Florida, he states
that in "about an hour he had collected
all the eggs he could conveniently
handle, about 125 sets."</p>

<p>This is an outrageous piece of bird-slaughter.
It is especially to be deplored
because Brown Pelican quills and back
feathers are fast becoming fashionable,
and, unless the species is protected, Florida
will speedily lose one of its most characteristic
and interesting birds. But how
can we expect women, unfamiliar with the
bird in nature, to aid in its protection,
when people who have seen it in its haunts,
and know how much it adds to Florida's
coast scenery, ruthlessly destroy it.</p>

<p class="caption2">The Conducting of Audubon Societies</p>

<p>It is one thing to organize a society or
club and quite another to set it upon a
permanent footing and keep it in step with
the constant requirements of progression.
At a time when a great majority look
askance at the startling array of societies
that they are asked to 'join,' it behooves
all Bird Protective bodies to conduct
themselves with extreme conservatism,
that they may not bear the stigma of being
called emotional 'fads,' but really appeal
to those whom they seek to interest.</p>

<p>Many men (and women also) have many
minds, and a form of appeal that will
attract one will repel another. It is upon
the tactful management of these appeals
and the bringing of the subject vitally
home to different classes and ages, that the
life of the Audubon Societies depends.</p>

<p>Leaflets have their influence with those
who already care enough to take the
trouble to read them. Special exercises
in schools have a potent influence for
good. But the best method of spreading
the gospel of humanity, is that by which
it was first spread 1900 centuries ago, by
personal contact and the power of the
human voice. A few spoken words are
worth a score of printed ones. A compelling
personality is worth a well of ink
in this Bird Crusade of 1899. Let the
heads of societies come in contact with
the members as much as possible, and
gather them in local circles. Let those
who are able to speak about birds do so,
and let those who lack the gift of words
read aloud from the works of others.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, urge local secretaries
to hold bird classes during spring and
summer in their respective towns. If no
one person knows enough to teach the
others let them club together, buy a few
books, and, going out of doors, work out
the problems of identification as best they
may, until every little village has a nature
study class working its way, Chautauqua-Circle
fashion. Remember one point,
please. No society can succeed that is
content to count the quantity rather than
quality of its members. One hundred
intelligent members who know how to
spread the <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> of the crusade
are worth 10,000 who have merely
'joined' because someone they were proud
of knowing asked them to and it was
easier to say 'yes' than 'no,' especially as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">-&#8239;65&#8239;-</a></span>
the <i>saying</i> was all it cost. Also, no society
succeeds that <i>bores</i> people into joining
it. Remember that no matter how
near one's own heart a project may be,
we have no right to <i>force</i> it upon others.
We have no right to take people by the
throat, so to speak, to make them pause
and listen, but setting a high standard,
holding out a helping hand and making
the way attractive to those who wish to
reach it is a different thing, and is the
only sane policy under which Audubon
Societies can be conducted. One word to
you who wish to see the societies
flourish, who love birds, but are shy
and retiring, and do not care to commit
yourselves to joining anything. You may
safely join the cause in <i>spirit</i> by sending a
nice little check to the treasurer of your
local state society. Piers Plowman discovered
long ago that he couldn't "spede"
far without money, neither can the Audubon
Societies.&mdash;M. O. W.</p>


<p class="caption2">A Letter from Governor Roosevelt</p>

<p>At the annual meeting of the New York
State Audubon Society, held in the American
Museum of Natural History on March
23, 1899, a letter was read from Governor
Roosevelt, which is of such interest and
importance that we print it in advance of
a <a href="#NEW_YORK_SOCIETY">report of the meeting</a>, which will appear
in a future issue.</p>

<p>Governor Roosevelt regretted his inability
to be present, and addressed the
following letter to Mr. Frank M. Chapman,
Chairman of the Executive Committee:</p>

<p class="tdl"><i>My dear Mr. Chapman</i>:&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>I need hardly say how heartily I sympathize
with the purposes of the Audubon
Society. I would like to see all harmless
wild things, but especially all birds, protected
in every way. I do not understand
how any man or woman who really loves
nature can fail to try to exert all influence
in support of such objects as those of the
Audubon Society.</p>

<p>Spring would not be spring without
bird songs, any more than it would be
spring without buds and flowers, and I
only wish that besides protecting the
songsters, the birds of the grove, the
orchard, the garden and the meadow, we
could also protect the birds of the sea
shore and of the wilderness.</p>

<p>The Loon ought to be, and, under wise
legislation, could be a feature of every
Adirondack lake; Ospreys, as every one
knows, can be made the tamest of the
tame, and Terns should be as plentiful
along our shores as Swallows around our
barns.</p>

<p>A Tanager or a Cardinal makes a point
of glowing beauty in the green woods,
and the Cardinal among the white snows.</p>

<p>When the Bluebirds were so nearly
destroyed by the severe winter a few
seasons ago, the loss was like the loss of
an old friend, or at least like the burning
down of a familiar and dearly loved
house. How immensely it would add to
our forests if only the great Logcock were
still found among them!</p>

<p>The destruction of the Wild Pigeon
and the Carolina Paroquet has meant a
loss as severe as if the Catskills or the
Palisades were taken away. When I
hear of the destruction of a species I feel
just as if all the works of some great
writer had perished; as if we had lost all
instead of only part of Polybius or Livy.</p>

<p class="ind30">Very truly yours,</p>
<p class="ind40"><span class="smcap">Theodore Roosevelt</span>.</p>


<p class="caption2">Reports of Societies</p>


<p class="caption3">PENNSYLVANIA SOCIETY</p>

<p>The Audubon Society of Pennsylvania
was organized in October, 1896, and was
the first society to follow the admirable
example set by Massachusetts. During
the first year 2,200 members were enrolled
and nearly 30,000 circulars distributed.
The first annual report was sent out in
November, 1897, and it mentions a 'Hat
Show,' and a course of lectures to be given
in Philadelphia during the spring. Both
of these were carried out with marked success,
the 'Hat Show' attracting much
attention to the work of the society, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">-&#8239;66&#8239;-</a></span>
the lectures adding materially to its
income, as there are no dues of any kind
connected with membership. The second
annual report appeared in November,
1898, and announces an increase of 1,100
members during the year. It referred to
the fact that as a direct result of the 'Hat
Show' several of the best milliners had
established special Audubon departments.
Lectures were given in many parts of the
state with most satisfactory results, and
finally, the co&ouml;peration of school teachers
was solicited to observe May 5, 1899, as
Bird-Day. A course of five lectures, by
Mr. Stone, will be given this year at the
Acorn Club, Philadelphia, beginning
March 16. A number of new slides have
been bought by the society to illustrate
these lectures, and the course promises to
be more interesting than ever. Since the
second report was issued seven new local
secretaries have been secured, making 42
in all. It is hoped that this number will
be doubled during the coming year, for as
the membership, which is now nearly
3,800, continues to increase, the need of
workers throughout the state becomes
more important every day.</p>

<p class="caption3">INDIANA SOCIETY.</p>

<p>In 1889 the Indiana Academy of Science
appointed a committee, of which I
was chairman, to secure the passage of
a satisfactory law for bird protection.
The committee accomplished nothing. It
was continued, and in 1891 secured the
enactment of the enclosed law. The
Academy of Science has, through its
efforts in the way of advancing science
work in the public schools of the state,
encouraged and taught bird protection.
In this it has had, since 1890, the co&ouml;peration
of the Indiana Horticultural Society.</p>

<p>In 1897 at different times several bodies
were interested in the movement in favor
of bird protection. These appointed committees
united in a
call for a meeting to be held at Indianapolis.
A programme was prepared, and
the meeting held in the State House
April 26, 1898. I send you a copy of
the call and programme; also of the constitution
of the Indiana Audubon Society.
The Governor, and Superintendent of
Public Instruction have both been much
interested, and as a consequence Bird
Day and Arbor Day were celebrated
October 28, 1898. The "Outline of
Township Institute Work" has gone into
the hands of every teacher and school
officer in the state&#8230;. You will
see that the work we are doing is practical,
even though it is not so much as
some States are accomplishing. I have
not the enrollment or statement of publications
issued, but counting the issue of
the State Department of Public Instruction,
20,000 copies of different articles, at
least, have been distributed.</p>

<p class="caption3">ILLINOIS SOCIETY.</p>

<p>The past year has shown a very marked
improvement as the results of bird protection
and the general work of our Illinois
Audubon Society. While the fashion for
decorating hats with feathers still continues,
yet there is a very noticeable
decrease in the display of aigrettes and
the feathers of wild birds. I have visited
the establishments of several of our Chicago
wholesale milliners and find that the
larger portion of their stock, this fall, is
made up of the feathers of the domestic
fowl and game birds. Our Audubon Society
has had two public meetings this year,
which were well attended, and the interest
in its work has rather increased than
abated. Our membership has increased
to 3,426. We have liberally distributed
leaflets, including 500 of our circulars,
stating the purpose of the society, to the
editors of local newspapers in the state,
with request that they aid the society by
publishing same and calling attention to it
editorially.</p>

<p>On February 7, 1898, an Interstate Convention
was held in Chicago, represented
by the game and fish wardens, and delegates
appointed by the legislatures of the
six states which responded to the call. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">-&#8239;67&#8239;-</a></span>
the request of Mr. Witmer Stone, I presented
at this convention the text of a new
law for the protection of birds and their
nests and eggs, as drafted by our committee
on Bird Protection. The convention
agreed to submit the proposed
law to each of their respective legislatures.</p>

<p>Great credit is due to the efficient work
which has been done in our state by Warden
H. W. Loveday and his deputies.
Since the first of the year over one hundred
prosecutions and convictions have
been made, for the wanton killing and
trapping of song and insectivorous birds
by men and boys largely Italians and Bohemians.
In 1897 there were 580 convictions
in the state for the illegal killing and transportation
of game birds. This year the
game has been so carefully watched and
such prompt action taken of reported cases
of violation, that the poachers and market
hunters have been less bold, and the number
of arrests and seizures of game have
been reduced over one-half.</p>

<p>On April 9, 1898, as a result of the
efforts of County Superintendent of Schools
Mr. Orville T. Bright, a meeting was held
in Chicago in the interest of the school
teachers of Cook county. Over three hundred
were present, and the meeting was
devoted exclusively to birds, and addresses
given by several members of the Audubon
Society. A "Finding List" of sixty species
of birds, compiled by Mr. Frank E.
Sanford, Superintendent of the La Grange,
Ill., Schools, was distributed. This is a
most effective method to inspire the teachers
and in turn impart their love for birds
to the scholars.</p>

<p class="caption3">IOWA SOCIETY.</p>

<p>Under the auspices of the Keokuk Woman's
Club, the Audubon Society of Iowa
was organized April 5, 1898.</p>

<p>The first work taken up was the establishment
of Bird Day in the public
schools.</p>

<p>The second meeting was held in Rand
Park. Short talks were made by Hazen
I. Sanger, John Huiskamp, Rabbi Faber,
Doctor Ehinger, and a paper was read
by Miss Read.</p>

<p>We have bought and distributed through
the schools, from kindergarten up, bird
pictures and bird literature.</p>

<p>One of our men milliners asked to become
a member.</p>

<p>On August 6 the officers of the society
met and adopted articles of incorporation,
this being the first Audubon Society to
be incorporated under the laws of Iowa.
The laws of Iowa give fair protection to
the birds; our work is in creating the
right sentiment.</p>

<p class="caption3">MINNESOTA SOCIETY</p>

<p>Mr. John W. Taylor, President of the
Minnesota Audubon Society, reports the
passage of a law establishing Arbor and
Bird Day in Minnesota, and writes: "It
is, as you can well imagine, a source of
great gratification to the lover of birds in
the state, and especially to the Audubon
Societies. Through this law we can do
more towards bird protection than we
could accomplish in many years' labor
without it. It brings the subject before
the teachers and children, and as you
educate the child so you mould the man.
We have now in this state 58 branch
societies, besides many school organizations
and children's bird clubs. The
number of members I am not able to
give, as I have not all the reports in. We
have sent out considerable literature, and
used the press largely to interest our
people. We feel that we are doing wonders
for the first active year we have had,
and congratulate ourselves that the hardest
work is done. We hope by April 1st to
have a branch in every county in Minnesota."</p>

<p class="caption3">REVISED EDITION</p>


<p>In preparing this Manual, it has been the author's aim to propose, within the comprehension
of grammar school pupils, a few of the problems which arise in a thoughtful
study of nature, and to offer suggestions designed to lead to their solution.</p>

<p>That pupils need some rational and definite directions in nature study, all are generally
agreed. But to prepare the outlines and suggestive directions necessary, and to
place these within the reach of each pupil, is more than any ordinary teacher has time
to do, even granting that she is fully prepared for such work. The utter futility of
depending upon oral suggestions during the class hour, when the pupils are supposed to
be doing individual work, is easily apparent on a moment's reflection. With a manual of
directions in hand, each pupil may be made strictly responsible for a certain amount of
work, either in the field or in the laboratory. This removes all occasion for that interruption
in his work, which is, otherwise, due to the pupil's attempt to <i>think</i> and at the
same time <i>hear</i>, what the teacher says.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em"><span class="hidden">G</span>ANNETS (<i>Sula bassana</i>) are known to nest in only three
places in North America&mdash;Perroquet Island, the Bird
Rocks, and Bonaventure Island, all in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence. By far the largest colony is found on the last
named island, where, on the ledges of the red sandstone
cliffs, some three hundred feet in height, they are practically
secure from molestation. Bonaventure Island itself, however,
is the most accessible of the three localities mentioned,
and may be easily reached in a small fishing boat
from the neighboring village of Percé, where the famous Percé Rock,
with its colony of Herring Gulls and Double-crested Cormorants,
makes the region particularly interesting to the ornithologist.</p>

<p>The Gannet cliffs are on the east side of Bonaventure, and are
exposed to the full force of the sea. To visit them satisfactorily,
therefore, one should select a calm day, when one may closely
approach the cliffs, and view with both safety and comfort the long,
white rows, containing thousands of birds nesting on the shelves
and ledges on the face of the cliff; a remarkable spectacle!</p>

<p>The unusually turbulent sea which prevailed during my visit to
these cliffs, on July 11, 1898, prevented me from securing satisfactory
pictures from a boat, but, landing on the west side of Bonaventure,
I crossed the island (here about one and a half miles in width), and
reached a position on the crest of the cliffs, from which the accompanying
picture was made. About four hundred Gannets are shown
nesting on this single ledge&mdash;one of many quite as densely populated.
Preparations were made to secure a picture of these birds on the
wing, but my best efforts to startle them into flight did not succeed
in making a single bird leave its nest!</p>

<div class="dropcap">A</div>
<p class="p0">lthough the Nutcrackers
and Jays were
masters of the feast,
they did not altogether monopolize
it. Ground squirrels
with golden brown heads and
striped backs would look out
at me from the rocks, and
pretty little striped-nosed
chipmunks would pick up
choice morsels and climb nimbly
back along the cliff with
them. Juncos often dropped
in, pecked indifferently at the crumbs, slipped off the tin cans they
tried to perch on, and flew off. Two Lewis' Woodpeckers stopped
one day and, flying down, clung awkwardly to the side of the cliff,
as if vaguely wanting to join in the proceedings, but not knowing
how, finally left. A single Steller's Jay hung around the outskirts
in the same way, the first day I was there. He hopped
about, looked this way and that, and pecked at the food perfunctorily,
as if it was new to his palate and not quite to his mind,
acting altogether as if he realized that something was going on he
ought to be enjoying, though he really didn't see just where the
fun came in. Unlike the Woodpeckers, however, he was determined
to improve his opportunities, and cultivated his appetite so successfully
that on the last day when I visited the dining-room he and a
comrade were working away, apparently enjoying the viands as much
as their neighbors.</p>

<p>But the Crows and Oregon Jays were the regular habitues of the
place. When resting from his labors a solitary Crow would often
perch on the tip of a bare spar on the crest of the cliff, apparently
quite satisfied with his own society, but I never saw a Jay there, and
one whom I did see separated from his band for a moment fairly
made the welkin ring with shouts for his clan. Several Clark's Crows
were often at the table with the Jays, but while I never saw a Crow
disturb a Jay, a Crow would often fly with animation at a newcoming
fellow Crow. This was a surprise to me, for on Mt. Shasta I had
seen the Nutcrackers hunting in bands quite as the Jays did here.
But on the wide lava slopes of Shasta there were, doubtless, grasshoppers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">-&#8239;73&#8239;-</a></span>
enough for all the world, while here the feast was restricted
to the foot of one cliff on the mountain&mdash;quite a different matter.
When I spoke to Mrs. Langille about this difference in disposition,
she acquiesced as if it were an old story to her, unhesitatingly
denominating the Jays 'generous fellows,' and the Crows 'greedy'
ones.</p>

</div>

<p>One Crow made a special exhibition of egoistic tendencies. He
was engaged in hurriedly carrying off future breakfasts for himself
when a party of brother Crows appeared. He had been working with
absorption, flying back and forth to the table with eager haste, being
gone less than half a minute at a time, but on the arrival of his
friends dropped his work and devoted himself to driving them from
the field. Not content with keeping them from the table, he flew at
them with a strange note of ominous warning when they sat quietly
in the tree-tops. It seemed as if he were nervous lest they discover
what he had been storing among the branches. When he had fairly
routed the enemy he apparently acted on his fear of discovery, for,
instead of placing his supplies near at hand as before, he flew out
of sight with them. As before, he worked with nervous haste. As
I looked down on the tree-tops from above it was impossible to see
where he put all the food, but several times when he flew up in
sight he seemed to be sticking small bits between the needles of the
pines. As the bunches of needles are compact and stiff in this
white-barked pine (<i>Pinus albicaulis</i>), this might be a safe temporary
cache, but the winter gales that make it necessary to hold down the
Inn with huge cables would presumably
leave little biscuit between
the needles of a pine.</p>

<p>The question is, do these
birds&mdash;and others which hoard&mdash;really
use their stores? The
testimony of all who are in the
field in winter is needed to clear
up the matter. The first point
to be determined is whether the
individual birds winter where
they store. The Nutcrackers,
Mr. Langille informed me, do
remain at the high altitudes
all the year. As he said, it is stormy indeed when they cannot
be seen sailing across the cañons or perched on the topmost
branches of the trees, screaming and calling in their harsh way,
always restless and seeming to resent any intrusion of man, beast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">-&#8239;74&#8239;-</a></span>
or fowl. On the other hand, he said that the Jays seldom remain
at the high altitudes during the winter months, usually descending
to lower elevations, where they flit about in flocks of from six to
twenty, sounding their plaintive varied notes and whistles at all
times.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 297px;">

<span class="fig_caption">CLARK'S CROW<br />
<span class="smaller">Photographed from nature by Walter K. Fisher</span></span>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, the storing of the Crows at this altitude was certainly
much less systematic than that of the Jays. The Jays' movements
were easy to follow, for they were concerted and regular. The
Inn was on a ridge between two cañons, and commanded the
birds' pathway. A band would come up from under the cliff at the
top of the western cañon, cross over the ridge, and drop down into
the eastern cañon, where they would fly over the tops of the firs
till they disappeared from sight. They would be gone some little
time, and then return empty-handed to repeat the performance.</p>

<p>The Jays talked a good deal in going back and forth, and their
notes were pleasantly varied. One call was remarkably like the
chirp of a Robin. Another of the commonest was a weak and rather
complaining cry, repeated several times; and a sharply contrasting
one was a pure, clear whistle of one note followed by a three-syllabled
call, something like <i>ka-wé-ah</i>. The regular rallying cry was still
different, a loud and striking two-syllabled <i>ka-wheé</i>. The notes of
Clark's Crow often suggested the rattling of the Red-headed Woodpecker.
The bird had a variety of <i>kerring</i>, throaty notes, and when
disturbed, as at the unexpected sight of me at its dining-room, gave
a loud, warning <i>quarr</i>. Besides these Woodpecker-like calls, it had
a squawking cry similar to that of Steller's Jay.</p>

<p>The voices of the birds were often heard from the house as they
got water from the hydrant in front of the Inn, the Jays frequently
stopping on the way back from their cañon storehouse. Sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">-&#8239;75&#8239;-</a></span>
three Jays would suddenly appear overhead, drop noiselessly to the
pool under the hydrant, and squatting close together fill their bills
and then raise their heads to swallow. Though the Jays usually went
to the pool for water, they would sometimes light on the hydrant and,
leaning over, drink from the faucet,
which Mrs. Langille always left
dripping for their benefit. The
Clark's Crows, so far as I noticed,
always drank right from the faucet.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 188px;">

<span class="fig_caption">CLARK'S CROW<br />

</div>

<p>It was hard to get photographs
of the birds at the hydrant, as they
stopped only in passing, but as it
was impossible to take them under
the cliff on account of the poor
light, I determined to bait them.
Finding a number of the Nutcrackers
in front of the kitchen
window, I asked the Chinaman for
some meat for them, holding up my
Kodak to explain that I wanted to
take the birds' pictures. To my surprise,
the man promptly and decidedly shook his head! I didn't know
what to make of such apparent rudeness at first, but it finally dawned
on me that he could not understand English and, not being an ornithologist,
from past experience with tourist cameras concluded that
I wanted <i>his</i> picture! Accordingly, nothing daunted, I appealed to
Mrs. Langille, and when she gave me a plate of suet, returned to
take the Crows. They flew at my approach, but quickly settled back
and fairly fell on the meat I put in the road for them. I got a snap
of one with a big mouthful. After taking all the Nutcrackers I
wanted, I went back to the hydrant to wait for the Jays, but the
Crows followed and one fellow fairly gorged himself on the fat. He
gulped it down so fast I had to drive him off in order to have either
meat or films left for the Jays. It was hard to persuade him that I
wanted him to leave. He had had no experience of such inhospitality.
Mild shooing did no good. I actually had to throw small stones at
him before he would take the hint! When he finally started to go,
I got his picture as he turned and looked regretfully over his shoulder
at the Jay he was leaving in possession of the field.</p>

<p>The Jays were even more fearless than the Crows. Several of
them would often be on the ground at once, but they ate so fast
and flew back and forth so rapidly that it was hard to focus on
them quickly enough to get their most interesting poses. I put a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">-&#8239;76&#8239;-</a></span>
brown paper behind or under the pan for a lighter background, and
at first the birds hopped nervously when it moved, but they soon
got used to it, and ate on it and on the pan, as it happened. And
how they did stuff! They were so absorbed that, although I sat
within four feet of the pan, they sometimes came too near for me to
focus. They paid so little heed to my presence I have no doubt
they would have eaten from my hand had I not been engaged in
keeping them at a proper distance. When the raw meat was gone
Mrs. Langille gave me a supply of cooked fat, and it was astonishing
to see how much of the greasy stuff they could swallow. I
caught one just as he was about to fly off with a billful of it. The
fat seemed to make them thirsty; they had to go to the hydrant to
wash it down with cold water.</p>

</div>

<p>Meat Hawk, the name the mountaineers have for them, is
certainly appropriate. They are on
the lookout for meat wherever it is
to be found, be it kitchen door or
forest. Their appetite for game is
truly remarkable. Mr. Langille told
me he might go through the woods
all day without seeing a single Jay,
but if he killed a deer and the smell
of blood filled the air, in a few
moments the birds would be about,
calling and whistling; and, emboldened
by the prospect of a feast, they
would fly down and perch upon the
carcass within reach of his hand, sometimes before the deer was
entirely skinned.</p>

<p>On Mount Shasta, although the Nutcrackers came about camp,
they showed no desire for camp food, and on Hood Mr. Langille
informed me that the Crows tamed this year were the first they had
ever succeeded in coaxing about. After I left the mountain they became
still more familiar, and, I am told, would gather in the trees at
daybreak and call until the family went out to feed them.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">N</span>ear Boonton, N. J., it was my good fortune last
summer to have the exceptional opportunity of watching
closely the rearing of a family of Chimney Swifts.
The nest was built opposite and slightly above an
opening in the chimney designed for the insertion of
a stovepipe. The opening was about two feet from
the floor of a second-story room in the house where I
spent the summer.</p>

<p>When discovered, the nest was only partially completed,
so it was necessary to exercise care, lest the
birds become alarmed and choose a more secluded spot. To guard
against disturbance to them, a black cloth was hung over the opening
in such a way that it could be carefully and noiselessly lifted during
periods of observation. Although the room was used as a bedchamber
throughout the summer, the Swifts never seemed to be annoyed by
the close proximity of their human neighbors. They were of a trustful
disposition, and soon became accustomed to being watched. Occasionally,
when I looked in upon them at the beginning of our acquaintance,
they would spread their long, beautifully formed wings and lift
them gracefully above the back, as if intending to fly, but usually,
upon second consideration, would conclude it was unnecessary.</p>

<p>It was the 21st of May when I first peeped in upon the little
bracket against the chimney wall that became the stage for the enactment
of scenes filled with absorbing interest to me in the weeks that
followed. It was not placed in an angle, but against the north side
of the flue, beneath a slight projection formed by an accumulation of
soot.</p>

<p>In a week one egg was apparent, but there may have been others,
for the little builders had been adding one twig after another to the
front edge of the nest, so that it had become impossible to see the
bottom. Two more days passed, after which it could be seen that
there were at least two eggs, and yet the structure continued to be
enlarged.</p>

<p>June 5 marked the beginning of incubation. In mid-afternoon
of this day I saw the sitting bird had flown, and, going out-of-doors
to study birds, my attention was attracted to a Swift flying among
the branches of the locust trees near by. This was an unusual sight
to me, and, recalling that I had read that Swifts never alight in trees,
I watched eagerly to see what it might mean. Soon I saw that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">-&#8239;79&#8239;-</a></span>
bird was snatching at little dry twigs. She flew round and round,
and presently was gone. Suspecting that it was my little friend, I ran
quickly upstairs, and sure enough, there sat my bird upon the nest,
with a twig in her mouth, panting as if tired by extra exertion. Resting
a moment, she proceeded to apply the salivary glue and adjust
the twig, and then settled again to the task of sitting.</p>

<p>After a few days there came a cold storm, and it was believed that
the little brooder proved unfaithful to her duties, for late one evening
and early the following morning she was seen huddled with others
of her kind beneath the nest. Great were my fears that no birds
would ever come from these chilled eggs, but time made it clear that
the tiny creature knew what she was doing. This was the sole act
of parental neglect that was apparent during all the weeks required
to rear the family. Under date of June 17, I noted that the eggs
were constantly protected. At whatever time of day I looked I saw
a sitting bird.</p>

<p>June 24 dawned fair and warm. As was my custom, I called
to say "good morning" into the chimney before going down to breakfast,
when I found that there was excitement in the little home. A
faint peep reached my ear, which caused the mother anxious restlessness
each time it was repeated. From half-past eight until ten
o'clock that morning I sat at my post of observation, during which
time it appeared that two or three more young were hatched, for
there was much peeping on the part of the little ones and much
fidgeting about by the adults. Two shells, or parts of shells, were
tossed from the nest. Occasionally the parents exchanged places,
one brooding the infants while the other went out into the air. Even
at the tender age that must be reckoned by minutes, these young
birds were fed, seemingly, by regurgitation.</p>

<p>During the progress of my study I found that one of the pair,
which from manners and appearance I judged to be the female, had
lost a tail feather, and this one I affectionately dubbed "Swiftie."
She appeared worn out with anxiety added to the confinement of a long
period of incubation, and embraced every opportunity to rest, but
seasons of sleep were of short duration, for it seemed that the body
of the brooding bird was lifted each time a movement was felt
beneath. The mate, with his sleek coat, bright eyes and calm
demeanor, formed a decided contrast to the ragged, unkempt appearance
of the female.</p>

<p>Even four days showed perceptible growth in the swiftlings.
They were not allowed to remain uncovered, a wise precaution, for
their bodies were perfectly naked. At this age the instinct of cleanliness
began to assert itself. The weak, awkward little creatures would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">-&#8239;80&#8239;-</a></span>
struggle backward from beneath the brooder, up to the edge of the
nest and deposit over it that which, remaining within, would have
made their home uninhabitable.</p>

<p>From this time forth a third Swift was seen to enter into the care
of the nestlings, taking its turn at brooding and feeding. Was this
a nurse-maid employed to relieve the overburdened mother, or a kind
and helpful friend or neighbor, or the younger and less care-taking
of two wives? Who can tell?</p>

<p>It was not until the sixth day after hatching that I knew to a
certainty how many young birds there were. Then, to my surprise, I
found there were five. They had grown to be very clamorous for
food. Two, at most three (later but one), were served at one feeding,
and the process was after this manner: "Swiftie" would drop
into the chimney and alight below the nest, her throat bulging with
the fullness of captured insects. The little ones that were hungry
were alert, for all had learned that a rumbling noise in the chimney,
followed by a sound of "chitter, chitter, chitter," meant something to
eat. After resting a moment, the mother would scramble up over the
nest, and, with closed eyes, feel about until she came in contact with
an open mouth, whereupon she would place her beak far down the
throat, deposit a portion of food, then seek another yawning cavity.
No system appeared to be observed in the matter of feeding. The
hungriest youngsters made the greatest effort to reach the source
of supply.</p>

<p>July 1 feathers began to appear. They grew rapidly, especially
those of wings and tail, and in a week the bodies were about
covered. With feathers came employment, for they must often be
dressed, though from a habit of yawning frequently, common to the
family, one might be led to believe that time hung heavily on their
claws.</p>

<p>The nestlings were two weeks old before the eyes began to open,
and nearly three before they were much used. But when they were
fully open, and the feathers had grown out and were fast becoming
sooty instead of black, how winning these young birds appeared!</p>

<p>The time had now come to take up exercises preparatory to flying.
The young aspirants would stand in the nest and for a time
vibrate the wings rapidly, so rapidly that the identity of wing was
lost. Two first ventured from home when nineteen days old, clinging
to the wall for a short time a few inches from the nest.</p>

<p>One afternoon about this time there came a severe and prolonged
shower. The rain beat into the chimney, reaching down to the nest.
What, now did I see? Besides the five grown-up swiftlings, the
three adults, packed in and upon the nest, the rain dripping from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">-&#8239;81&#8239;-</a></span>
those which were exposed. I mention this incident to give an idea
of the adhesiveness of the glue used in the construction of Swifts'
nests.</p>

<p>July 20 I made the following note: "Swiftlings no longer
make use of the nest, but dispose themselves in various parts of the
chimney, sometimes in a cluster, sometimes in twos or threes, and
sometimes separately. They take flying exercises up and down the
chimney, but I believe have not yet left it." The next morning I was
forced to conclude that three had taken flight into the great outside
world, for upon looking the chimney over thoroughly with the aid of
a small mirror, I could find but two birds.</p>

<p>The chimney was much used by this interesting family until the
24th of August. Early in the morning of that day a large number of
Swifts were seen gathering in a flock at a short distance from the
house. Ten o'clock that night I searched the chimney with a
lighted candle, but found no sign of life, and I believe that the
Swifts did not again enter within its walls.</p>

Skimmer risks her set of eggs,
and, while apparently unprotected,
they are so much the color of the
sand and the surrounding shells and
seaweed that they would not be
noticed unless you were especially
looking for them.</p>

<p>The Skimmers are gull-like in
form, with long, slender body and
long wings, spreading almost three
feet. They have a glossy black back,
white breast, orange feet, and a most
curiously shaped orange bill, which is almost as thin as a knife, the
thin edges closing vertically together. This peculiarity has given
the bird the name of 'Razor Bill.'</p>

<p>Their graceful and regular flight can hardly be mistaken for that
of any other bird. They skim just over the surface of the water,
following the contour of the waves, while the lower mandible of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">-&#8239;82&#8239;-</a></span>
bill, which is longer than the upper, projects below the surface of the
water, and when it comes in contact with a small fish, the latter
simply slide up the narrow, inclined plane into the Skimmer's
mouth.</p>

<p>Formerly they bred in great numbers along the eastern coast of
our Middle and Southern Atlantic states, and only a few years ago
were abundant on the New Jersey coast. They have been crowded
out, however, by encroaching civilization, and hunted down by the
milliners' agents and the egg-collectors. In June, 1898, I found them
on Cobb's Island, Virginia, to the number of about two hundred pairs,
where, not long ago, they bred in thousands.</p>

<p>As the eggs are entirely exposed, the parents are relieved to
some extent from the duty of incubation by the heat of the sun,
and as soon as the young hatch they run about like chickens.</p>

<p><span class="hidden">H</span>is range being southern, Cardinal Grosbeak seldom
travels through New England; and, to my knowledge,
has never established a home and reared a
family north of Connecticut until in the instance
here recorded. Kentuckians claim him, and with some show
of right, since James Lane Allen built his monument in imperishable
prose. But, soon or late, all notables come to Boston, and
among them may now be registered the "Kentucky Cardinal."</p>

<p>Shy by nature, conspicuous in plumage, he shuns publicity; and,
avoiding the main lines of travel, he put up at a quiet country house
in a Boston suburb&mdash;Brookline.</p>

<p>Here, one October day in 1897, among the migrants stopping at
this half-way house, appeared a distinguished guest, clad in red, with
a black mask, a light red bill, and a striking crest; with him a bird
so like him that they might have been called the two Dromios. After
a few days, the double passed on and left our hero the only red-coat in
the field. A White-throated Sparrow now arrived from the mountains,
and a Damon and Pythias friendship sprang up between the
birds. Having decided to winter at the North, they took lodgings in
a spruce tree, and came regularly to the table d'hote on the porch.
My lord Cardinal, being the more distinguished guest, met with particular
favor, and soon became welcome at the homes of the neighborhood.
With truly catholic taste, he refused creature comforts from
none, but showed preference for his first abode.</p>

<p>It was March 5, 1898, when we kept our first appointment with
the Cardinal. A light snow had fallen during the night, and the air
was keen, without premonition of spring. It was a day for home-keeping
birds, the earth larder being closed. The most delicate tact
was required in presenting strangers. A loud, clear summons,&mdash;the
Cardinal's own whistle echoed by human lips&mdash;soon brought a response.
Into the syringa bush near the porch flew, with a whir and a
sharp <i>tsip</i>, a bird. How gorgeous he looked in the snow-laden shrub!
For an instant the syringa blossoms loaded the air with fragrance as a
dream of summer floated by. Then a call to the porch was met by
several sallies and quick retreats, while the wary bird studied the
newcomers. Reassuring tones from his gentle hostess, accompanied
by the rattle of nuts and seeds, at last prevailed, and the Cardinal
flew to the railing and looked us over with keen, inquiring eye. Convinced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">-&#8239;84&#8239;-</a></span>
that no hostilities were intended, he gave a long, trustful look
into the face of his benefactress and flew to her feet.</p>

<p>A gray squirrel frisking by stopped at the lunch-counter and seized
an 'Educator' cracker.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">CARDINAL AND GRAY SQUIRREL</span>
</div>

<p>The novel sensation of an uncaged bird within touch, where one
might note the lovely shading of his plumage as one notes a flower,
was memorable; but a sweeter surprise was in store. As we left the
house, having made obeisance to his eminence the Cardinal, the bird
flew into a spruce tree and saluted us with a melodious "Mizpah."
Then, as if reading the longing of our hearts, he opened his bright
bill, and a song came forth such as never before enraptured the air of
a New England March,&mdash;a song so copious, so free, so full of heavenly
hope, that it seemed as if forever obliterated were the "tragic
memories of his race."</p>

<p>As March advanced, several changes in the Cardinal were noted by
his ever-watchful friends. He made longer trips abroad, returning
tired and hungry. The restlessness of the unsatisfied heart was
plainly his. His long, sweet, interpolating whistle, variously rendering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">-&#8239;85&#8239;-</a></span>
"Peace &#8230; peace &#8230; peace!" "Three cheers, three cheers,"
etc., to these sympathetic northern ears became "Louise, Louise, Louise!"
Thenceforth he was Louis, the Cardinal, calling for his mate.</p>

<p>On March 26, a kind friend took pity on the lonely bachelor, and
a caged bird, "Louise," was introduced to him. In the lovely dove-colored
bird, with faint washings of red and the family mask and
crest, the Cardinal at once recognized his kind. His joy was
unbounded; and the acquaintance progressed rapidly, a mutual understanding
being plainly reached during the seventeen days of cage
courtship. Louis brought food to Louise, and they had all things in
common except liberty.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/pg_85.png" width="323" height="151" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">CARDINAL AND HOUSE SPARROWS</span>
</div>

<p>April 12, in the early morning, the cage was taken out-of-doors and
Louise was set free. She was quick to embrace her chance, and flew
into the neighboring shrubbery. For six days she reveled in her new-found
freedom; Louis, meanwhile, coming and going as of old, and
often carrying away seeds from the house to share with his mate.</p>

<p>April 16, he lured her into the house, and after that they came often
for food, flying fearlessly in at the window, and delighting their friends
with their songs and charming ways. Louis invariably gave the
choicest morsels to his mate, and the course of true love seemed to
cross the adage; but alas! Death was already adjusting an arrow for
that shining mark.</p>

<p>April 25, Louise stayed in the house all day, going out at nightfall.
Again the following day she remained indoors, Louis feeding her;
but her excellent appetite disarmed suspicion, and it was thought that
she had taken refuge from the cold and rain, especially as she spent
the night within. The third morning, April 27, she died. An examination
of her body revealed three dreadful wounds.</p>

<p>Louis came twittering to the window, but was not let in until a
day or two after, when a new bird, "Louisa," had been put in the cage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">-&#8239;86&#8239;-</a></span>
When he saw the familiar form, he evidently thought his lost love
restored, for he burst into glorious song; but, soon discovering his
mistake, he stopped short in his hallelujahs, and walked around the
cage inspecting the occupant.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 194px;">
<img src="images/pg_86.png" width="194" height="181" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">CARDINAL</span>
</div>

<p>Louisa's admiration for the Cardinal was marked; but for some
days he took little notice of her,
and his friends began to fear that
their second attempt at matchmaking
would prove a failure.
April 30, however, some responsive
interest was shown, and the
next day Louis brought to the
cage a brown bug half an inch
long, and gave Louisa his first
meat-offering.</p>

<p>The second wooing progressed
rapidly, and May 7, when Louisa
was set free, the pair flew away
together with unrestrained delight.
After three days of liberty,
Louisa flew back to the house with her mate, and thenceforth was a
frequent visitor.</p>

<p>May 21, Louisa was seen carrying straws, and on June 6 her nest
was discovered low down in a dense evergreen thorn (<i>Crat&aelig;gus pyracantha</i>).
Four speckled eggs lay in the nest. These were hatched
June 9, the parent birds, meantime and afterward, going regularly to
market and keeping up social relations with their friends.</p>

<p>In nine days after their exit from the shell, the little Cardinals left
the nest and faced life's sterner realities. A black cat was their worst
foe, and more than once during their youth Louis flew to his devoted
commissary and made known his anxiety. Each time, on following
him to the nest, she found the black prowler, or one of his kind,
watching for prey. On June 28, the black cat outwitted the allied
forces, Señor Cardinal and his friends, and a little one was slain.
The other three grew up and enjoyed all the privileges of their parents,
flying in at the window and frequenting the bountiful porch.</p>

<p>July 25, Louisa disappeared from the scene, presumably on a
southern trip, leaving the Cardinal sole protector, provider and peace-maker
for their lively and quarrelsome triplet. A fight is apparently
as needful for the development of a young Cardinal as of an English
schoolboy, possibly due in both cases to a meat diet.</p>

<p>Over-feeding was but temporary with our birds. On the 8th of
August the migratory instinct prevailed over ease, indulgence, friendship,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">-&#8239;87&#8239;-</a></span>
and the Cardinal with his brood left the house where he had
been so well entertained, to return no more. No more? Who shall
say of any novel that it can have no sequel? Massachusetts may yet
become the permanent home of the Kentucky Cardinal, the descendant
to the third and fourth generation of Louis and his mate.</p>

<div class="dropcap">T</div>
<p class="p0">he subjects of this sketch had located their bark- and root-lined
nest of coarse sticks, four feet from the ground, in
a little oak bush surrounded by brakes, sunflowers, and hazel.
Instead of being, as usual, in the midst of a dense, and, therefore,
dark thicket, this nest was quite in the open, shaded by only a few
overhanging, leafy branches of small size. Its exceptionally favorable
location and the apparent tameness of the birds suggested an
attempt at avian photography, and the undertaking was entered upon
at once, a very considerable fund of interest and enthusiasm having
to take the place of any special previous experience in this line of
work. After clearing away a little of the overhanging and intervening
vegetation, the camera was placed with the lens not more than two feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">-&#8239;88&#8239;-</a></span>
from the nest, this being necessary in order to secure an image of the
desired size with the short focus lens at hand (a B. and L. Zeiss Anastigmat,
Series II A, 6<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> × 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, focal length 5<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches). Fifty feet of
rubber tubing, a large bulb, and a field-glass made it possible to
watch developments and carry on operations from a safe distance.
But, although the camera was nearly concealed with ferns and leaves,
this day's proceedings were not rewarded with much success. The
birds proved exasperatingly timid, and returned only after prolonged
waits, to disappear instanter on the click of the shutter (a B. and L.
iris diaphragm shutter). So we left the field, not disheartened but
bent upon improving our paraphernalia. A day or two later found
the camera again in position, but this time with tripod green-painted
and the whole unsightly top enveloped in a green hood with only
a small aperture for the lens. This ruse succeeded fairly well, and
during the three or four hours that the light was good on this day,
and during a like period on a subsequent day, a number of exposures
were made that resulted in an interesting series of negatives, giving
good prints and still better lantern slides.</p>

<div class="dropcap">B</div>
<p class="p0">efore saying a few words on this subject, I
should like to define my position. With all my
heart do I disapprove of caging wild birds. I
never had, and never shall have, the liberty of one
bird interfered with for my pleasure or study, and if
I had the power to prevent it, not one should ever
be caged. Especially do I regard it as cruel in the extreme
to confine an adult bird, accustomed to freedom and able to
take care of himself.</p>

<p>The question of "rights" we will not enter upon here, further
than to say that our moral right to capture wild creatures for our
own use or pleasure is the same in the case of birds as of other
animals&mdash;horses, for example.</p>

<p>But birds <i>are</i> caged, and we must deal with circumstances as we
find them. If a bird-lover should worry and fret himself to death,
he could not put an end to their captivity. So it would appear to
be the part of wisdom to see if there are not mitigating circumstances,
which may comfort, and perhaps, in a slight degree, even
reconcile one to their imprisonment.</p>

<p>The case of Canaries is different from that of all others.
Hatched in cages, descended from caged ancestry, and accustomed
to be cared for by people, they know no other life, and are utterly
unfitted for freedom. So far from being a kindness to set one of
these birds free, it is absolute cruelty. It is like turning a child,
accustomed to a luxurious life, into the streets, to pick up a living
for himself.</p>

<p>But a young bird, taken from the nest before he has learned
the use of his wings, I believe, can be made perfectly contented and
happy in a house&mdash;<i>if he is properly cared for!</i></p>

<p>It is unfortunately true that not one in a thousand <i>is</i> properly
cared for, but we are not considering the shortcomings of people.
At this moment we are considering the possibility of making a bird's
life happy.</p>

<p>For several years I kept birds in captivity, and closely studied
their ways and their characters, and I say, without hesitation, that
most birds can be made so contented and happy that they will prefer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">-&#8239;90&#8239;-</a></span>
their captivity, with its several advantages, to freedom without them.
The advantages of captivity to a bird are three; viz., abundant food
supply, protection from enemies, ease of life&mdash;without labor or
concern about weather.</p>

<p>The conditions, therefore, necessary to his happiness are: Never-failing
care as to his physical comforts&mdash;such as a proper situation
of the cage,&mdash;neither in the hot sunshine nor in a draught; fresh
and perfect food, with variety; plenty of fresh water; suitable and
regular bath, etc. And secondly&mdash;though perhaps it should be first,
as it is most important&mdash;treatment as if he were a sentient being,
instead of a piece of furniture; talking to him, taking notice of him,
making a companion and friend of him. And thirdly, the freedom of
a room, at least part of every day.</p>

<p>Under these conditions, as I know from close and sympathetic
observation, our little brothers can be made so happy, that, as I
said, many of them will not accept their liberty. They choose
between freedom, with hard labor and many anxieties, and comfortable
captivity, with ease and security, and many decide&mdash;as do
many of the human family&mdash;for the former.</p>

<p>There is another reason why I have become partially tolerant
of the caging of birds. What first influenced me was the fact that
every individual rescued from the discomforts of a bird store, where
they are seldom well cared for and never cherished, is greatly benefitted,
and I felt that to be a work of charity.</p>

<p>But there is one strong argument in favor of the custom. That
is, their great value as a means of educating children. Nothing is
more important than the training of our youth in humanity and
respect for the rights of others. And in no way can this be so well
accomplished as by giving to them the care of pets. By investigation
of prisons and reform schools, it has been amply proved that
nothing so surely keeps a boy from falling into a criminal life as
the care of and kindness to the lower orders. The daily care of a
pet bird is a daily lesson in altruism which never fails to bear fruit.</p>

<p>In those precious first years of the child's life, when the mother
has the power of instilling lessons that will be a part of him,&mdash;the
most indelible he will ever receive,&mdash;if she takes a little pains to do
so she can implant, with the love of creatures dependent upon him,
qualities that will go far to make him a true, manly man.</p>

<p>While these considerations do not, perhaps, make it right to deprive
a fellow creature of his liberty, they do furnish a little consolation
to those who love humanity as well as birds. At the same time I
must admit, that of all pitiful sights on earth, that of a neglected
captive is one of the most heartrending.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">T</span>here is a bird pasture, as I call it, about a half hour's
ride from Boston, and thither I went on May 30, 1898,
to see if I could find the nest of a White-eyed Vireo
that I had often hunted for in years gone by, but
never yet succeeded in finding.</p>

<p>This bird pasture, on one side of which runs the
road, consists of eight or ten acres of old, wet pasture
land on a hillside surrounded on two other
sides by fields and an orchard, and immediately
above a marsh in which the sedges and grasses grow
luxuriantly, and which is bordered by alders, birches and other
swamp-loving trees. The pasture itself is very wet in one portion,
and has been overgrown with birch, alders, oak and tangles of grapevines,
wait-a-bits, poison ivy, etc. In another part it is more open,
and is more sparsely covered with red cedars and white pines, while
the ground is dotted with wild roses and hard-hack, interspersed with
clumps of alders. This combination of hill and marsh, field and
orchard, cover and open, as well as evergreen and deciduous growth,
makes it an ideal place for birds and their breeding; and one that
is hard to duplicate in any locality, combining also woods and civilization
as it does, for there are houses and barns in the immediate
vicinity. You probably cannot duplicate this pasture, but those of
you who love birds, and who can find any spot approximating this
in conditions, would do well to appropriate it, metaphorically speaking,
as I have this.</p>

<p>But to return to the birds&mdash;I thought I would carefully note all
those I saw or heard in the course of a short hour I had to spare,
and with the following results: As I took down the bars in order
to take my bicycle into the pasture, a Baltimore Oriole was singing
on top of an elm close by, and I have no doubt that its mate was
sitting on the nest that hung pendent from the next tree. A Catbird
slunk off into the bushes to the right of me, from a thicket in which
she last year raised a brood; and, while chaining my wheel, I heard
the glorious notes of a Brown Thrasher singing, a little way off, on
the top of a tall white oak. Several Red-eyed Vireos were there
too, their steady, rippling song forming a soft accompaniment to the
more conspicuous notes of the other feathered songsters. Next, I
flushed a Quail, and, while watching its flight, I almost stepped on
two more, which got up from the under-brush at my feet.</p>

<p>I started in now on my hunt for the White-eye's nest, and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">-&#8239;92&#8239;-</a></span>
some time was so absorbed in that, and in listening for its expected
song, that there was no time to make notes of the other birds heard,
except that of a Wood Thrush, whose nest contained four eggs, and
was saddled on the crotch of a grape-vine, where it crossed through
the crotch of an alder.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, I did not find the Vireos, or even
hear them, though for several years they had lived here throughout
the summer. I finally went out into an open space, lighted a pipe
as a mosquito preventive, and, seating myself on the soft side of a
boulder, put down the names of the birds whose notes I could hear.</p>

<p>Below me, in the swamp, the most prominent notes were the
'concarees' of the Red-winged Blackbirds, while between them could
be heard the songs of several Swamp Sparrows. Close beside me
were a Chestnut-sided and a Golden-winged Warbler, both seemingly
much disturbed by my presence, while just as near was a Maryland
Yellow-throat, an old friend of mine, who did not seem to care
whether I was there or not. This same friend is rather a curiosity,
for, although his species usually build in or about the marshes or
swamps, he always prefers the hillside, and I last year found his nest
within forty feet of where I sat, and several hundred feet away from
and above the swamp.</p>

<p>A few Cedar Birds were whispering from the tops of a couple of
red cedars about fifty yards away, and I could hear a Yellow Warbler
on the other side of the open space, where he sang, apparently for
the benefit of a near-by barberry bush.</p>

<p>A Wood Pewee was uttering his plaintive note from the orchard
immediately back of me; while just back of that, in the field by the
top of the hill, could be heard the rollicking notes of a Bobolink and
the occasional call of a Meadow Lark. While writing my notes, some
kind of a large Hawk, which flew so fast that identification was
impossible, but which I guessed to be a Cooper's Hawk, went
off rapidly across the marsh, pursued by a pair of vociferous Kingbirds;
and, as I watched them, I could see numbers of Chimney
Swifts, from the neighboring chimneys, and Barn Swallows, from a
barn close by, coursing about above the marsh after the insects that
there abound, the Swallows low down and the Swifts above. While
watching the Swallows, two Crows came out of the wood on the
opposite side of the marsh, and flew, cawing, across and off into the
distance; and a little Green Heron, who, like all fishermen, prefers
quiet, flew off in another direction.</p>

<p>Down towards the edge of the swamp, in the outlying thicket,
a Song Sparrow was singing, while, close by, a magnificent Rose-breasted
Grosbeak, which every year builds in the birches which grow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">-&#8239;93&#8239;-</a></span>
in these thickets, was warbling his incomparable song. At first he
had been giving vent to his very unmusical call of alarm, but, becoming
used to my presence, and concluding that I meant no harm, he
joined in the concert.</p>

<p>Off to one side, among the more scrubby deciduous growth, I
could hear, and sometimes see, a Redstart, while the <i>tse-tse-tse</i>-ing of
the Black-poll Warblers, which were migrating northwards, could be
heard intermittently. Two Quails were now calling loudly for Bob-White,
or Rob-ert-White, as their fancy dictated, and in the confusing
medley I could make out the modest notes of a Black and
White Warbler, which had for years nested somewhere in this pasture.
Behind me, at the top of the hill, I could also hear the clear,
cheery notes of a Field Sparrow, which always builds there.</p>

<p>Being limited as to time, and having already heard twenty-eight
kinds of birds in the short space of about twenty minutes, and from
one place, I started to depart, but even as I did so I heard the notes
of another bird coming across the marsh, that of the Black-billed
Cuckoo, and just as I was again taking down the bars to get out into
the street, what should I hear, loud, clear and distinct, but the song
of that plaguey little White-eyed Vireo, a song seemingly of thanksgiving
that I was really going and that he had eluded me so well. I
then reluctantly mounted my bicycle, but was forced to get off, to add
two more birds to my increasing list; viz., a Cowbird, which was
sitting on the fence opposite, and a pair of Yellow-throated Vireos,
the female of which had evidently but just left her nest for a lunch,
while the male followed twittering and whispering close by, stopping
his song until she should have resumed her duties of incubation.</p>

<p>I had now seen thirty-two different species of birds in the short
space of about twenty-five minutes' actual time spent in observation,
after deducting the time spent in hunting the Vireo's nest, and departed
for home well content, even though I knew I had seen only about
three-fifths of the varieties of birds that are often to be found in the
immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>On a previous occasion, when I had been lucky enough to be
able to spend a whole morning in this pasture, I had seen forty-four
different species, nineteen of which I had not seen to-day, and which,
added to the thirty-two noted above, make a total of fifty-one species.
Of these, there were only five that were merely occasional visitors.
Of the remainder, I have found direct evidence of the breeding of
thirty-two species, while on various accounts I feel sure that fourteen
others breed there, although I have never actually found their nests.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">W</span>e had planned to walk over to the pond to see if
the recent thaw had spoiled the skating. As we
passed the foot of the hill, the little brook
splashed and tumbled down from its icy framework,
eddying around the brown goldenrod stalks,
and then rushed on at topmost speed across the
opposite meadow.</p>

<p>We were standing on the little bridge, watching
the ever fascinating current, when an odd bird-note called our
attention to a little gray-backed, white-breasted bird who was
running up and down a neighboring tree.</p>

<p>All thoughts of skating instantly vanished from our minds; we
climbed the fence, and in a moment more were noiselessly following
our obstinate little bird, who would keep so high up in the tree-tops
that it was almost impossible to see anything but his breast.</p>

<p>Finally, he descended, head downward, along one of the lower
branches of the tree, and we saw that it was a White-breasted Nuthatch.
Evidently he thought he had stayed quite long enough for
examination, so, after a few parting pecks at the rough bark, trying
to secure one more hidden insect, he flew off.</p>

<p>We were slowly following the course of the little stream, when
suddenly a great rustle of the dead leaves near the water's edge
caused us to pause and listen. All was silent, with the exception of
a few distant Chickadees, then, with a whir and a clatter, we saw a
bushy tail disappear into the thicket; a moment more and out came
a beautiful gray squirrel. Like a flash he was up the tree, jumping
from limb to limb, frisking about in the sunshine, then down onto
the ground again, and away. His visit was even shorter than that
of the Nuthatch, but not less enjoyable.</p>

<p>And now, where were those noisy little Chickadees who had been
calling to us from the alder bushes for the last half-hour? It was
easy enough to find these confiding little creatures; they were feeding
on the ground, and seemed quite unconcerned at our presence, although
we approached very near to them. One little fellow seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">-&#8239;95&#8239;-</a></span>
to be asleep; he sat all puffed up on one of the alder branches, but
as I came nearer to him I could see that his bright little eye was
on me, and at the next step he flew away.</p>

<p>It was now late in the afternoon, and, as we looked toward the
west, the last rays of the sun were just tinting the distant hills with
a mellow, golden hue; the birds had flown away, leaving the woods
silent, so we reluctantly turned our footsteps towards home.</p>

<p class="caption3">Inquisitive Magpies</p>

<p>I was collecting specimens of natural
history in the northern part of the state
of Washington, a few miles from the
Canadian border. At the time the incident
which I am about to relate occurred
I was stopping at a ranch at the southern
end of Okanagan lake.</p>

<p>The owner of the building was cramped
for room, so, as it was during the heat of
the summer, I spent the nights rolled up
in my blankets under a haystack. One
morning, as the sun was rising, I was
awakened by shadows crossing my face,
and opening my eyes saw a flock, possibly
a family, of Magpies perched on the stack
and ends of poles that had been thrown
over it to keep the hay from blowing
away. I watched them as they peered
inquisitively at me from their perches,
until finally one flew to the ground, then
another and another, until at last several
were gathered about me, but a few feet
away. I lay on my side, with my arms
under the blankets, and watched their
actions. At last one jumped on the
blankets at my feet. I could feel him
hopping slowly upward. I did not move
for fear of frightening him. Finally he
reached my shoulder, and, after perching
there a few seconds, flew to my cheek.
I closed my eyes slowly, fearing he might
peck them. After testing my cheek lightly
with his bill, he began to get in some
uncomfortably heavy blows, so I thought
it time to stop him. Without opening
my eyes, or moving, I said in a low tone.
"Here! Here! That will do!" He hesitated,
as if to make sure his ears had not
deceived him, and then flew to the stack.
Another took his place, after working up
in the same manner; he was quietly asked
to move on. When the next one hopped
on the blankets, I slowly raised my hand
under them, making a tempting elevation,
of which he was not slow to take advantage.
He lighted squarely in the palm of
my hand, which I closed at once, and
held him prisoner. With the other hand
I caught him by the legs from the outside,
whereupon he flopped his wings,
cried out with anger, and pecked at my
wrist savagely. The remainder of the
flock, which, in the meantime, had flown
to the haystack, scolded and jabbered
away at a great rate.</p>

<p>Evidently they had taken me for a
corpse, but I think it was the liveliest
one they ever saw.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Alden Loring</span>,

<p class="caption3">Songs of Birds</p>

<p>The songs of birds have attracted a
good deal of attention in recent years,
and observation seems to confirm the
theory that each generation of birds
learns the song characteristics of its
species by association with its own kind.</p>

<p>This fact was brought quite clearly to
my mind several years ago, when in a
western town I was taken to a neighbor's
to see his birds. Four cages swung in
the shelter of a commodious porch. One
contained a Red-winged Blackbird, that
had been taken from its nest when very
young, and brought up by hand. His
associates were a Canary, a Blue Jay
and an Oriole. The Canary had been
purchased at a bird store, and had there
learned its song. The Blue Jay and
Oriole had been taken from neighboring
nests, and had, no doubt, picked up the
characteristic notes of their species from
the many other members of their kind
that inhabited the vicinity, but it was
many miles to the nearest swamp or low
land where one might find a Red-winged
Blackbird. This Red-wing had learned
perfectly the notes of his caged companions,
and had picked up some notes
of other birds in the neighborhood, but
not one note of the Red-winged Blackbird
did he know.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Frank E. Horack</span>,

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Birds.</span> By <span class="smcap">A. H. Evans</span>, M.A. The
Cambridge Natural History, Vol. IX.
London: Macmillan and Co., Limited.
New York: The Macmillan Company.
1899. 8vo, pages xvi + 635. Numerous
woodcuts in text. Price, $3.50.</p>

<p>The author of this compact volume has
essayed what he himself recognizes as the
"difficult and apparently unattempted
task of including in some six hundred
pages a short description of the majority
of the forms in many of the families, and
of the most typical or important of the
innumerable species included in the large
Passerine order."</p>

<p>The book opens with a "Scheme of the
Classification Adopted," based on the system
proposed by Gadow, in which the
<i>Arch&aelig;opteryx</i> stands at the bottom of
the list, followed by the Ostriches, Rheas,
and other struthious birds, while the
Finches are placed at the top. An introduction
of twenty-two pages treats of
feathers, color, the molt, the skeleton,
digestive organs, etc., classification, terminology,
geographical variations, and migration,
the handling of the last two subjects
being far from satisfactory.</p>

<p>The remainder of the book is devoted to
a consideration of the birds of the world.
The matter is selected with excellent
judgment and is admirably put together,
the text having an originality and freshness
not often found in compilations. The
author, however, is handicapped by lack
of space, and, except in monotypic families,
is, as a rule, obliged to generalize to
such an extent that the seeker for information
concerning certain species will usually
find only the characteristic habits of its
family given. But if the author has not
achieved entire success, he has, perhaps,
more nearly approached it than any of
his predecessors, and in his work we have
for the first time an authoritative handbook
of the birds of the world, which is
sold at a low enough price to be within the
reach of every student.</p>

<p>The illustrations, with the exception of
a comparatively few, which were taken
from duly credited sources, are by Mr. G.
E. Lodge, who, at his best, is, in our
opinion, one of the foremost of bird
artists.&mdash;F. M. C.</p>


<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">The Feeding Habit of the Chipping Sparrow,
and the Winter Food of the
Chickadee.</span> By <span class="smcap">Clarence M. Weed</span>,
New Hampshire College, Agricultural
Experiment Station.</p>

<p>In the first of these interesting papers,
Dr. Weed has introduced us directly into
the domestic life of a family of Chippies.
We have a view, for one day, of all their
affairs, both personal and domestic; and
to many it must be a wonderful revelation.
It is fortunate for the birds that their
period of infancy is so short, as otherwise
their parents must utterly break down with
the task of filling their ever-open mouths.
Beginning at about 3:57 in the morning,
these devoted parents worked almost without
cessation till 7:50 in the evening, bringing
food to their four young on an average
of twelve times an hour; or once every
five minutes.</p>

<p>What would human parents think of such
work? The question arises: When do
the old birds eat? In the case of a nest of
this species watched by the writer on July
11, 1898, feeding of the young ceased at
7:25 in the evening, when both parents flew
away. In twenty-five minutes, that is, at
7:50, the female parent (presumably) returned
and settled on the nest for the night.
At that time it was so dark that all other
birds had disappeared. It seems probable
that in this last twenty-five minutes the
parent birds filled their own stomachs for
the night.</p>

<p>The second of these papers is of a more
prosaic character, but not the less interesting
or useful. We have here a record in
detail of the winter food of the Chickadee,
showing how largely it consists of those
minute insects, or their still more minute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">-&#8239;98&#8239;-</a></span>
eggs, that injure the trees and baffle the
efforts of man for their extermination.</p>

<p>In both papers we are shown the unpoetical
but useful side of bird-life. These
two confiding little birds have endeared
themselves to their human neighbors by
their gentle ways and familiar habits; but
in these papers Dr. Weed has shown us that
they should be no less dear to us when
viewed entirely from an economic standpoint.
We hope he will give us more of
this kind of literature.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. E. L. Beal.</span></p>

results of ten years' observation,
including also such information as he has
gathered from other naturalists concerning
the 187 species recorded from the region
of which he writes. Mr. Dearborn's notes,
we are glad to say, are not restricted solely
to statements concerning the rarity or
abundance and manner of occurrence of
a given species, but often contain valuable
remarks on habits which show him to be
a discriminating student of the living
bird.&mdash;F. M. C.</p>


<p class="caption3">Book News</p>

<p>The origin of the present widespread interest
in ornithology is so largely due to the
influence of Dr. Coues' classic 'Key to
North American Birds,' that we are sure
bird students throughout the world will
welcome the news that its author is engaged
in a thorough revision of his epoch-making
work. The new edition, which will be
expanded to fill two volumes, will be richly
illustrated by Mr. Fuertes, and while the
advance made in the science of ornithology
in the fifteen years which have elapsed
since the publication of the second edition
naturally leads us to expect some improvement
in this forthcoming edition, our credibility
in the powers of human achievement
is severely taxed when Dr. Coues asks us
to believe that the new 'Key' will be as
far ahead of the second as the second was
beyond the first.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Bird-Lore's Motto:</b></p>

<p class="center"><i>A Bird in the Bush is Worth Two in the Hand.</i></p>

<hr class="chap" />


<p>It has recently been remarked that the
field ornithologists of to-day are of two
kinds: first, those who collect; second,
those who observe. The status of these
two types of ornithologists, and the parts
they play in the advancement of the
science of ornithology, is a subject of the
utmost importance to every one interested
in the study of birds.</p>

<p>A consideration of it leads us to review
briefly the progress which has been made
in our knowledge of North American
birds during the past twenty-five years.
At the beginning of this period the Smithsonian
Institution contained the only large
collection of North American birds in the
world, and our data concerning the exact
distribution and relationships of even our
commonest species was of the most meager
character. Since that date the publication
of Baird, Brewer and Ridgway's 'History
of North American Birds', of Coues'
'Key' and Ridgway's 'Manual'; the
organization of the American Ornithologists'
Union and of the Biological Survey
of the Department of Agriculture, and
the establishment of several natural history
museums, have given a wonderful
impetus to the collecting of birds. Naturalists
have explored every corner of the
eastern United States, and, with almost
equal thoroughness, the western states,
and the fruits of their labors are shown in
the large series of birds now possessed by
our leading museums. In fact, we have
now reached a point where only a thoroughly
trained ornithologist or his personally
directed assistants can make collections
which will be of real scientific value.
Indiscriminate collecting, therefore, particularly
in the eastern United States, in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred will
only result in the duplication of material
already existing.</p>

<p>Not only has there been a great advance
in the requirements of collecting, but in
the study of the specimens collected, and
the systematic ornithologist who would
hope to add anything to our knowledge of
the distribution and relationships of any
group of North American birds, must
possess advantages which can be afforded
only by well-equipped museums.</p>

<p>Turning, now, to the other class of ornithologists,
the collectors of facts, we find
that they have been far less active than
collectors of skins. Thus, while we rarely
or never refer to Wilson or Audubon or
Nuttall for information concerning the
systematic position of a species, these
early writers are still authorities on facts
connected with the life histories of many
of our birds.</p>

<p>This subject has been brought very
forcibly to our mind by two papers published
in this number of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>, and,
without going into details, we wish collectors
of birds and their eggs would read
carefully the articles entitled 'The Cardinal
at the Hub' and 'Home-Life in a Chimney,'
and then tell us frankly whether they
do not think that the facts therein set forth
constitute a more valuable contribution
to the science of ornithology than a Cardinal's
skin and five white egg-shells. If
they are both discriminating and sincere,
we believe they will admit the truth of
<span class="smcap">Bird-Lore's</span> motto.</p>

<p class="caption3">A Bird Class for Children</p>

<p>One of the most frequent questions
asked by those seeking to win children to
an appreciation of birds is, "How, when
we have awakened the interest, can we
keep it alive?"</p>

<p>The only way to accomplish this, to my
thinking, is to take the children out-of-doors
and introduce them to the 'bird in
the bush,' to the bird as a citizen of a
social world as real in all its duties and
requirements as our own.</p>

<p>There is a group of people with ultra-theoretical
tendencies, who insist upon considering
the bird merely as a feathered
vertebrate that must not be in any way
humanized, or taken from its perch in
the evolutionary scheme, to be brought to
the plane of our daily lives. In teaching
children, I believe in striving to humanize
the bird as far as is consistent with absolute
truth, that the child may, through its
own love of home, parents, and its various
desires, be able to appreciate the corresponding
traits in the bird. How can this
best be done? By reading to children?
That is one way; and good, accurate, and
interesting bird books are happily plentiful.
But when the out-door season comes,
little heads grow tired of books, and anything
that seems like a lesson is repugnant.</p>

<p>Then comes the chance to form a bird
class, or a bird party, if the word class
seems too formidable. A dozen children
are quite enough to be easily handled.
The ages may range from six to twelve.
Arrange to have them meet outdoors once
a week, in the morning, during June and
July. A pleasant garden or a vineclad
piazza will do for a beginning; it is inadvisable
to tire children by taking them
far afield until they have learned to identify
a few very common birds in their
natural surroundings.</p>

<p>Children who are familiar with even the
very best pictures of birds must at first
be puzzled by seeing the real bird at a distance,
and perhaps partly screened by
foliage. The value of the out-door bird
class is, that to be successful it must
teach rapid and accurate personal observation.</p>

<p>"Very true," you say, "but the birds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">-&#8239;101&#8239;-</a></span>
will not stay still while the children are
learning to observe." Yes; yet this difficulty
may be met in two ways. If you are
so situated that you can borrow say
twenty-five mounted birds from a museum
or the collection of a friend, you will have
a very practical outfit.</p>

<p>Choose four or five birds, not more for
one day, take them outdoors, and place
them in positions that shall resemble their
natural haunts as much as possible. For
example, place the Song Sparrow in a
little bush, the Bluebird on a post, and
the Chippy on a path. Let the children
look at them near by and then at a distance,
so that a sense of proportion and
color value will be developed unconsciously.</p>

<p>After this, the written description of the
habits of the birds, which you must read
or tell the children, will have a different
meaning. This method may be varied by
looking up live specimens of the birds thus
closely observed.</p>

<p>"True," you say again, "but I cannot
beg or borrow any mounted birds."</p>

<p>Then take the alternative. Buy from
the Massachusetts Audubon Society, 234
Berkeley St., Boston, for a dollar, one of
its Audubon Bird Charts. This chart is
printed in bright colors and is accompanied
by a little pamphlet describing the twenty-six
common birds that are figured. These
are the (1) Downy Woodpecker, (2) Flicker,
(3) Chimney Swift, (4) Ruby-throated
Hummingbird, (5) Kingbird, (6) Bluejay,
(7) Bobolink, (8) Red-winged Blackbird,
(9) Baltimore Oriole, (10) Purple Finch,
(11) American Goldfinch, (12) Chipping
Sparrow, (13) Song Sparrow, (14) Scarlet
Tanager, (15) Barn Swallow, (16) Cedar
Bird, (17) Red-eyed Vireo, (18) Black and
White Warbler, (19) Yellow Warbler, (20)
Catbird, (21) House Wren, (22) Chickadee,
(23) Golden-crowned Kinglet, (24) Wood
Thrush, (25) American Robin, (26) Bluebird.
Cut the birds carefully from the
chart, back them with cardboard, and
either mount them on little wooden blocks,
like paper dolls, or arrange them with wires,
so that they can be fastened to twigs or
bushes.</p>

<p>You will be surprised to find how this
scheme will interest the children, who may
be allowed sometimes to place the birds
themselves.</p>

<p>For those too old for the cut-out pictures,
the teachers' edition of 'Bird-Life', with the
colored plates in portfolios, will be found
invaluable. The separate pictures may be
taken outdoors and placed in turn on an
easel behind a leaf-covered frame, with
excellent effects&mdash;a few natural touches and
the transition from indoors out often
changing one's entire point of view.</p>

<p>One thing bearing on the question of
bird study. If children ask you questions
that you cannot answer as they surely
will, do not hesitate to say "I don't know."
Never fill their minds with fables guised as
science, that they must unlearn.</p>

<p>Now a material point. When you have
entertained your class for an hour, never
more, lend the affair a picnic ending and
give them a trifling lunch before they go;
something very simple will do&mdash;cookies and
milk, or even animal crackers!</p>

<p>The young animal of the human species,
as well as many others, is a complexity of
stomach and brain, and it is well to administer
food to each in just proportion.</p>

<p class="caption3">Reports of Societies</p>


<p class="caption4">WISCONSIN SOCIETY</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth W. Peckham, secretary
of the Wisconsin Society, sends to Mr.
Stone the first annual report of that body,
from which we extract the following:</p>

<p>"This society was organized April 20,
1897. The first efforts of the executive
board were in the direction of securing the
co&ouml;peration of the press in this city and
throughout the state. The response was
most generous, and it is probable that
more effective work has been done through
this agency than in any other way.</p>

<p>"The next appeal was to clergymen of
all denominations, who were asked to
preach upon the fashion of wearing wild
bird feathers. Here, again, they received
valuable aid and encouragement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">-&#8239;102&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p>"In May, 100 circulars were sent to
Milwaukee milliners, asking their assistance
in the work of reform, and announcing
that there would be held, in the fall,
an Audubon millinery opening. This
opening, which took place in October,
was well attended, and served its purpose
in calling attention to the existence and
meaning of the society.</p>

<p>"The co&ouml;peration of the State Superintendent
of Public Instruction, and also of
the Board of School Directors of this city,
has been secured. The response of the
Milwaukee School Board was especially
cordial and encouraging. Talks upon the
subject of bird protection have already
been given in several of the city schools,
and it is intended that the main work of
the society for the coming year shall be
done among the teachers and school children
of the state.</p>

<p>"The society is much to be congratulated
in that, before it came into existence,
Bird Day had been established in Wisconsin.
We can only appreciate our good
fortune in this respect by noting the difficulties
that are thrown in the way of the
Audubon societies of other states when
they attempt to win the consent of their
legislatures to this step. We owe this
great advantage to Mr. J. E. Morgan, of
Sauk county.</p>

<p>"Although our Audubon Society is one
of the largest in the United States, we
are working under great disadvantages,
since we have, so far as we can discover,
the smallest income of them all. In
order that no one may be excluded, we
have made our life membership fee exceedingly
small, so that it brings in an
amount quite insufficient to meet the expenses
of printing, buying and distributing
literature. We therefore make an
earnest appeal to intelligent men and
women to become members of the society,
or to send us contributions of money.
We are especially anxious to increase the
number of our associate members, who
pay one dollar a year, and thus provide us
with a steady income."</p>

<p>Mrs. Peckham reports a total membership
of 5,141, and writes that since the
publication of the report from which we
have just quoted, "through the co&ouml;peration
of our State Superintendent of Public
Instruction, our society has formed
175 branches among the school children.
These branch societies include over four
thousand members, including teachers
and children."</p>


<p class="caption4">NEW HAMPSHIRE SOCIETY</p>

<p>On the 6th day of April, 1897, at the
call of Mrs. Arthur E. Clarke, a meeting
was held at her residence in Manchester,
for the purpose of organizing the New
Hampshire Audubon Society, which was
duly accomplished.</p>

<p>The work of the society throughout the
state is carried on by means of branch
societies, the presidents of which act as
vice-presidents of the state society; or,
when this is not practicable, local secretaries
are appointed to carry on the work,
and such secretaries have already been
appointed in more than twenty places.</p>

<p>Special pains has been taken to influence
the children in the public
schools. A junior Audubon society was
early formed, and a very interesting
meeting was held in June, 1897, at
which about three hundred school children
were present. A similar meeting
was held in June, 1898, and it is proposed
to hold others from time to
time.</p>

<p>With the same end in view, an 'Outline
of Bird Study' was prepared for
use in the schools.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of the society, extracts
from the game laws of the state,
relating to penalties for the destruction
of song birds and their eggs, have been
posted in conspicuous places, thanks to
the prompt and energetic action of the
street and park commissioners. Similar
action has been taken in various other
cities and towns.</p>

<p>Lectures were given by Mrs. Orinda
Hornbrooke, Mrs. Alice Freeman Palmer,
on 'The Educational Side of Bird Protection,'
and by Mrs. Harriet E. Richards,
secretary of the Massachusetts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">-&#8239;103&#8239;-</a></span>
society, on the general work of the Audubon
societies.</p>

<p>The society has distributed nearly 7,000
leaflets and circulars, several of them having
been procured of the United States
government, through the kindness of our
members of Congress.</p>

<p>An additional circular has recently been
issued in which prizes are offered to the
school children of New Hampshire on the
following conditions: Two prizes, one of
ten dollars and one of five dollars to children
over twelve and under seventeen
years of age; and two more, one of five
dollars and one of three dollars to children
under twelve years of age. These prizes
are to be awarded for the best compositions
on 'Birds,' the compositions to be
written as the result of personal observation,
the contest to close January 1, 1900.</p>

<p>The society has adopted the bird chart
lately published by the Massachusetts
Society, and is introducing it as rapidly as
possible into the schools of the state.</p>

<p class="caption4"><a id="NEW_YORK_SOCIETY"></a>A Message from Madame Lehmann</p>

<p>At the second annual meeting of the
New York State Audubon Society, Madame
Lilli Lehmann, whose love of animals
is perhaps even greater than her
love of music, made an eloquent appeal
to women to cease from feather-wearing,
which she characterized as a form of barbarism,
and to aid the Audubon Societies
in their efforts to protect the birds.</p>

<p>Through the editor of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>, she
sends to the Audubon Societies the following
message, the tenor of which, it
will be noticed, is in close accord with
the views of the editor of this Department,
as expressed in the <a href="#Editorial_a">last issue</a> of
this Journal.&mdash;F. M. C.</p>

<p>Madame Lehmann writes: "Tell the
Societies that I take the greatest interest
in their work, that I do everything I can,
and every minute, if the occasion offers,
to protect the birds.</p>

<p>"Tell them, also, that it is the duty of
everyone to <i>speak</i> and to <i>do</i> something
every day for the cause; that it is not
sufficient to give a dollar or two&mdash;that
alone will never help us. It is the living
word, the reasons given, the good example
and the <i>teaching</i> to everyone that
can bring us further in civilization."</p>


<p class="caption4">Two New Audubon Societies</p>

<p>We announce with pleasure the formation
of Audubon Societies in Texas and
in California. The Texas Society was
organized on March 4, at Galveston, with
Miss Cecile Seixas as secretary. The
organization of the California Society was
lately completed at Redland, with Mrs.
Geo. S. Gay as secretary. The addresses
of the secretaries of these societies are
given in our '<a href="#DIRECTORY">Directory</a>,' and we trust
that they will receive the co&ouml;peration of
all bird-lovers in their respective states.</p>


<p class="caption4">American Society of Bird Restorers</p>

<p>A <a href="#Bird_Restorers">report</a> of the work of the American
Society of Bird Restorers, prepared by
Mr. Fletcher Osgood, its organizer and
manager, will appear in <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> for
August.</p>


<p class="caption4">Birds and Farmers</p>

<p>It is pleasing to know that some farmers
are awakening to the fact that birds are
an important factor in agriculture. At
the last monthly meeting of the Farmers'
Club of the American Institute of New
York, the subject for discussion was "Birds
and Their Relation to Agriculture." The
subject was introduced by Mr. N. Hallock,
who presented a well prepared paper giving
much valuable information regarding
birds as insect destroyers. These statistics
were from publications of the U. S. Dept.
of Agriculture and from his own observations.
He strongly urged the protection
of all birds from the farmer's standpoint.
The paper was then discussed by the
members present. Mr. William Dutcher,
of the Executive Committee of the New
York Audubon Society, who was present,
addressed the Club, elaborating some of
the statements in the paper under discussion
and emphasizing the fact that
every bird an agriculturist permitted to
be killed on his farm was a direct loss to
him in money value.</p>

<p>In preparing this Manual, it has been the author's aim to propose, within the comprehension
of grammar school pupils, a few of the problems which arise in a thoughtful
study of nature, and to offer suggestions designed to lead to their solution.</p>

<p>That pupils need some rational and definite directions in nature study, all are generally
agreed. But to prepare the outlines and suggestive directions necessary, and to
place these within the reach of each pupil, is more than any ordinary teacher has time
to do, even granting that she is fully prepared for such work. The utter futility of
depending upon oral suggestions during the class hour, when the pupils are supposed to
be doing individual work, is easily apparent on a moment's reflection. With a manual of
directions in hand, each pupil may be made strictly responsible for a certain amount of
work, either in the field or in the laboratory. This removes all occasion for that interruption
in his work, which is, otherwise, due to the pupil's attempt to <i>think</i> and at the
same time <i>hear</i> what the teacher says.</p>

<div class="dropcap">M</div>
<p class="p0">y brother and I were both delighted to see the
first number of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>, and take the opportunity
of congratulating our naturalist and photographic
chums across the Atlantic upon having such a
practical and highly interesting magazine to help them
in their enchanting pursuits. Such a publication would
have been a veritable godsend to us when we started
our natural history photography.</p>

<p>As we have had a good deal of experience in circumventing the
cunning and timidity of the majority of wild creatures living in the
British Isles, and the same characteristics in this respect are common
to wild animals all the world over, I propose to tell by what means
we have secured some of our rarest pictures.</p>

<p>First of all, I ought to explain that we never use anything but a
strongly built, half-plate stand camera, fitted with a Dallmeyer stigmatic
lens, and an adjustable miniature on the top, which is used as
a sort of view-finder when making studies of flying birds and mammals
in motion. When fixed in position, and its focus has been set
exactly like its working companion beneath it, both are racked out in
the same ratio by the screw dominating the larger apparatus which,
when charged with a dark slide and stopped down according to the
requirements of light and speed of exposure, needs no further attention.
When the combination is in use, the photographer focuses
with his right hand, and, holding the air ball or reservoir of his pneumatic
tube in his left, squeezes it quickly and firmly directly he has
achieved a sufficiently clear and strong definition of his object upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">-&#8239;108&#8239;-</a></span>
the ground glass of the miniature camera. This enables the operator
to focus up to the last instant, and to select the best attitude of his
"sitter."</p>

<p>We have a silent time-shutter built in behind the lens, and for
very rapid work, such as flying bird studies, use a Thornton &amp; Pickard
focal plane shutter working up to the thousandth part of a second.</p>

<p>Good apparatus, that will work under almost any conditions with
precision and certainty, must be possessed for the achievement of
successful natural history work. We use
the quickest plates made in the old country
for the greater part of our work, although,
of course, for still objects full of color, we
cannot beat Ilford chromatic plates.</p>

<p>We soon discovered that it was absolutely
impossible to figure many timid birds
at close quarters without some natural contrivance
in which the camera and its operator
could be effectually hidden. For the
study of wood birds at home, we built an
artificial tree trunk of sufficient internal
capacity to contain either of two broad-shouldered
Yorkshiremen. This is how we
made it. Purchasing three pieces of stout
bamboo, each 7 feet in length, I split them
down the center and lashed each piece to
three children's bowling hoops, the topmost
and center ones being 24 inches in diameter,
and the bottom one 27, so as to represent
the base of a tree and give the legs
of our camera a greater stride. We then
covered the whole with galvanized wire and
a coat of green American cloth, which my
wife painted to resemble the bark of a tree.
After this we stuck bits of lichen and moss
on to it, and then passed a number of bits
of strong grey thread from the inside to the out. With these we tied
on several pieces of ivy stripped from adjoining tree trunks, so as to
make our contrivance look as natural as possible. How far we succeeded
in deceiving the feathered folks of Britain may be judged,
when I state that one day a Chaffinch alighted on the broken top
of our artificial forest monster and began to rattle off its song just
over the unseen photographer's head.</p>

</div>

<p>We should much like to hear of this device being tried by someone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">-&#8239;109&#8239;-</a></span>
on American wood birds. Whoever makes and gets laced up
inside an artificial tree trunk will discover that a peculiarly dizzying
sensation attends the first attempt or two to stand for any length of
time so encased.</p>

<p>For some birds we fix up a mock camera near their nests or feeding
haunts a few days before we attempt to make a picture. This
can be easily done with a small wooden box and tin canister with
its lid or bottom blackened to represent a lens.</p>

<p>For photographing ground builders, such as Larks, Plovers, and
so on, we built an artificial rubbish heap, such as farmers rake up off
their grass land before laying it down to grow for hay time, and cart
off to form rick bottoms.</p>

<p>This we made from an old umbrella, to the ribs of which we
lashed pieces of bamboo four feet in length. The whole was then
covered with brown holland. To the outside we tied innumerable
wisps of straw and rubbish, and as some sort of testimony to its efficacy,
I need only mention that we have succeeded in photographing
a Lark at her nest bang in the middle of a bare field, and one of our
very shyest British Plovers, quite recently, sitting on its nest within a
few feet of the lens.</p>

<p>We next come to a consideration of how to photograph the eyries,
eggs and young of such birds of prey as Eagles, Falcons and Ravens,
that breed, at any rate so far as Britain is concerned, in the most
inaccessible cliffs.</p>

<p>The first business is to secure a couple of climbing ropes. We
had ours specially manufactured for us, from the best manila hemp,
by a London rope-maker of good repute. They are each two hundred
feet in length. The guide rope is an inch and a half in circumference,
and the descending rope, which has three loops at one end
for the photographer to sit in, is two inches in circumference. It
will thus be seen that both ropes are pretty stout, some folks might say
unnecessarily stout, but it is better to be on the safe side, as a break
and a fall of three or four hundred feet onto jagged crags or into
the sea would be likely to send the photographer into perpetual
retirement.</p>

<p>It is a curious thing, but nevertheless true, that fictionists have
fixed one idea in the mind of the public in regard to the danger
attending a man hanging over a precipice on the end of a rope; viz.,
that all his danger comes from a probability of one or two of the
strands of his rope getting chafed in two over some sharp rock. I
am frequently asked, after my lectures, the question: "Has your
brother ever had a narrow escape from the rope nearly getting chafed
in twain?" They seem genuinely disappointed because he has not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">-&#8239;110&#8239;-</a></span>
been hauled up on the last faithful strand of a rope, with his hair
standing on end, his face o'erspread with an unspeakable horror, and
then fainted dead away on reaching <i>terra firma</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>I have heard a lot of terrible tales about chafing ropes, but as
a matter of fact, there are dangers a thousand times greater if less
picturesque; such, for instance, as a prosaic little stone, no bigger than
an orange, being dragged out of its bed by one of the ropes when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">-&#8239;111&#8239;-</a></span>
photographer is being hauled up a cliff, and, after dropping a hundred
feet or so, alighting plump on the head of the unsuspecting camera
man. My brother has had one or two narrow escapes of this kind,
though never the shadow of one from a chafing rope.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">PHOTOGRAPHING A CORMORANT<br />
<span class="smaller">From Kearton's 'Wild Life at Home,'
copyrighted by Cassell &amp; Co., Ltd.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Upon setting forth to photograph the eyries of cliff-breeding
birds, we equip ourselves with (1) our ropes; (2) a stout crowbar;
(3) a good, strong, level-headed assistant (nervous or careless assistants
should be studiously avoided, as the one kind of man is as dangerous
as the other), that can be relied upon; (4) a revolver; (5) a
camera; (6) a photographer who, in addition to being a good athlete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">-&#8239;112&#8239;-</a></span>
and gymnast, possesses no nerves at all, and can, in consequence, stand
on the very lip of a cliff a thousand feet sheer, as he would do on the
gutter edge of a sidewalk, and look straight below him.</p>

<p>I would advise all who do not possess the above qualities, more
or less, to leave cliff photography severely alone, as walking backwards
into a yawning abyss, even on the end of a good, stout rope,
feels uncommonly like stepping into eternity, and I would not like to
have the blood of any American cousin on my head.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the edge of any precipice wherein we suspect, say
an Eagle, to be breeding, we step as close to the lip of the crag as
possible. I hold the revolver over my head, fire, and watch to see
where a bird flies out. Should one do so we mark the spot, drive
our crowbar into the ground above it, tie one end of the guide rope
securely to it and fling the rest down into the chasm below. The
photographer lashes his camera to his back, dons the three loops at
the end of the descending rope round his hips, the rope is then
passed once round the crowbar, and the assistant pays it out from
behind, whilst the photographer, steadying himself by means of the
guide-rope, literally walks backwards down the cliff. Before going
down, however, he takes good care to clear away all the loose stones
and rubble, for if he did not do so they would be sure to be dislodged
by the rope when he comes up.</p>

<p>Upon reaching an eyrie, if it is situated on a ledge wide enough
to set the tripod of the camera on, he does so and makes his studies,
taking good care not to let go his ropes.</p>

<p>If the nest should be on a ledge too narrow to set the apparatus
upon, my brother passes two of the legs of his tripod through a belt
round his waist and the third into any convenient crevice he can
find, and with his body practically at right angles to the face of the
crag and his camera almost resting on his chest, focuses and takes
his picture.</p>

<p>I feel that I have barely touched the fringe of my subject in this
short article, but I have no doubt that to the man equipped with a
decent camera and a genuine love of nature, the hints I have given will
be sufficient to set him to work natural history picture-making, and,
as an old farmer, I know enough of American ingenuity in tool-making
to convince me that there is no bird or beast living in the western
world that cannot be photographed, living, loving, and laboring in its
free, open-air home. Any way, every reader of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> has the
best wishes of the brothers Kearton.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">T</span>he slate-colored Junco or Snowbird breeds very
abundantly in the fields of Digby county, Nova
Scotia, and its neat nests are often so artistically
placed that they are a continual temptation to the
naturalist photographer. One nest, in particular,
with four eggs, was especially beautiful, seen through
the ground glass of the camera, the contrast between
the eggs and the waxy green leaves and
scarlet fruit of the bunch-berries near it making
one long for color photography. This nest was in a field, five feet
from a road, and partly protected by a tiny bank of turf.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">NEST AND EGGS OF JUNCO</span>
</div>

<p>Five days after the photograph was taken the eggs hatched, and
four balls of long, jet-black fuzz appeared. Daily twelve-hour meals
of green measuring-worms, provided by the parents, wrought marvels
in the appearance of the young birds, and in a surprisingly short
time a second suit of streaked black and brown was assumed. In
this, perhaps, the facsimile of their ancestors' plumage, they left the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">-&#8239;114&#8239;-</a></span>
nest, and apparently lost individuality among the large flocks of their
species.</p>

<p>Another abundant summer bird of this part of Nova Scotia is
the Night-hawk, the name being almost a misnomer, as they are visible
in numbers, flying all day. But all do not depart from their
usual custom of sleeping during the day, as is shown in the accompanying
photograph, taken about 11 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> one August day, 1898.
While walking along a railroad track, I noticed this bird resting in
a fallen trunk about four feet from the track. I focused my
camera and made the exposure without disturbing the bird in the
least. A train had passed not long before, so it could hardly have
been asleep more than an hour. The characteristic longitudinal
position assumed by this bird in perching is well shown, and its
protective coloring makes it appear a mere excrescence on the bark.</p>

<p>When it awoke what a dream it might relate to its companions
of being approached by a horrible one-eyed, three-legged creature,
which at a glance made it immortal!</p>

<p>The photograph of the Junco's nest and eggs was made with a
128 opening and a 4-second exposure, while that of the Night-hawk

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">M</span>aple Lake, in St. Charles county, Mo., is one of a
series of lakes situated between the bluffs and the
Mississippi River. The bluffs are four to five miles
from the river bank, thus leaving a wide stretch of
alluvial land, lowest toward the bluffs, forming an extended,
nearly level marsh, mostly too wet and poor
for cultivation, and covered with square miles of cord-grass
(<i>Spartina cynosuroides</i>). In dry summers or on
higher levels it reaches only a height of three or four feet, but in
wet summers, as for instance in 1898, it attains the stately height of
six to eight feet, with such a dense growth of rigid leaves that it is
hard work to walk or even drive through. As a commercial article
it is worth very little, though it will make good paper. When young
it is liked by horses and cattle, and when two feet high it makes
pretty good hay, which is sometimes baled and sold as prairie hay.</p>

<p>But while man does not yet know how to make good use of it,
birds do, especially some species of the families Hirundinid&aelig; and
Icterid&aelig;&mdash;the Swallow and Blackbird families&mdash;who find in the spartina
the material for a good and safe dormitory. Hundreds of acres
of this grass cover the region about Maple Lake, and as they are
within the confines of one of the best managed club grounds, where
neither plow nor cattle, neither drainage nor fire are allowed, they
serve many kinds of birds for a roosting place at all seasons of the
year, but especially in fall migration.</p>

<p>Of Swallows, the most numerous frequenters are the Eaves, the
Tree or White-breasts, and the Roughwings, and they show their
appreciation of this rare place of security and peace by coming
early in the season and staying late. When the Eaves have become
strangers at their breeding stations for a long time, the marsh is
the place to find them in plenty. Here is the place to look for
the first White-breast of the year as early as the second week of
March, and for the last, in the third week of October. For two
months, from the middle of August to the middle of October,
a cloud of Swallows may be seen every evening, just before
dark, hovering over the most remote and inaccessible part of
the immense spartina waste, and wherever you are in the marsh
in the late afternoon, you cannot fail to notice innumerable Swallows
skimming the grassy ocean and the adjacent lakes. If toward
sunset you watch them closely, you will find that, though they
may linger long on some favorite hunting ground, the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">-&#8239;116&#8239;-</a></span>
trend is toward one particular region, and if you will wait long
enough, you will find that they have all disappeared in that direction
and that, when almost dark, belated parties passing by go in
a straight line direct for the same unknown destination. Certainly
a most interesting sight for the naturalist to see so many of these
lovely, lively, likely creatures passing over, about and around you,
all governed by one idea, all driven by one common impulse, all
eager to reach the same aim, the common roost! Where is the
roost? Where do all these birds spend the night? How do they
retire in the evening, and what is their conduct when they leave
their night-quarters in the morning?</p>

</div>

<p>In spite of their large numbers and generally unconcealed
activity, the answer to these questions is not quite easy. Otherwise
confiding creatures, Swallows are careful to keep the exact location
of their roost as much as possible a secret from the outer world.
Neither the persons who live in the neighborhood of the marsh,
nor the hunters who desecrate its sanctity, could tell you where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">-&#8239;117&#8239;-</a></span>
the Swallows roost. It requires the persistent efforts and full
attention of the naturalist to show you where and how his favorite
bird goes to rest and how it sets out and enters upon the duties
and pleasures of another day. You have to be after nightfall,
alone with the mosquitos and other pests, in the wide, wet and
pathless marsh, and again before the faintest glimmer announces
the approach of day.</p>

<p>But select a day in the latter part of August or the first half
of September, and follow me. We are up early, to be on the
grounds before 5 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>; the stars are vanishing, one after the other,
and the first dawn appears on the eastern horizon; the air is cool
and misty, the grass loaded with heavy dew, but we have to plow
our way through as best we can. By previous observation we have
located the whereabouts of our birds, and we are now fast approaching
their sanctum, all alive and alert for the expected disclosures.</p>

<p>Before this, only the hooting of the Barred Owl in the distant
woods had broken the silence, but now comes from the depth of his
private retreat, the sleepy 'seewick' of the Henslow's Sparrow, and
at the same time the weak but lively 'chip chip churr' of the Short-billed
Marsh Wren. 'Pink, pink, pink' exclaims the Bobolink, whom
we have startled from his slumber of repose, and, as we advance,
up go some Swallows, one by one, to the right, to the left, in front
of us, not in masses or bunches, but singly, every few yards one
or two flying up, silent, and on wings heavy with dew.</p>

<p>Dawn has been making fast progress the last few minutes, and
we can see quite a little distance through the misty air. Now is
the time when the Swallows begin of their own accord to leave
their perch down in the depths of the spartina and fly with heavy
wing through the cool and foggy layer below into the clearer
atmosphere above, where the sun's first rays will soon dispel the
chilly dampness of their plumage.</p>

<p>While we are still absorbed in the astounding spectacle, daylight is
stealing quietly into the novel scene, and discloses the presence of
greater and greater numbers of Swallows as far as the eye can reach.
Many have gained enormous heights, and are soaring majestically in the
sun-kissed zenith. Not so voiceless as the Swallows do the Bobolinks
leave the roost. Their <i>pink</i> is continually in the air, and numerous parties
are seen passing over, drifting into all directions of the compass.
Some alight again, all in their yellow traveling suits, with the exception
of one who has a little song for us and wears a somewhat mottled garb
with whitish rump. Long-stretched flocks of Redwings pass in one
direction, troops of Frackles in another; but, on the whole they do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">-&#8239;118&#8239;-</a></span>
present anything like the grand spectacle they will later in the year,
when migration sends millions of them to this marsh.</p>

<p>The sun is up now, and a little wind is stirring and dispels the
clammy dampness of the air. Short-bills sing on all sides, and a few
Marylands and Henslows are also heard to sing. Great Blue Herons
are on the move, and the Marsh Hawk is at work. A Bittern wings
its way across the marsh, attended by a committee of inquisitive
young Eaves. There is a peculiar movement now among the Swallows.
They seem to concentrate their forces. Let us follow them,
and be treated to an unexpected sight.</p>

<p>Fifty thousand Eave Swallows are seated on the protruding tops of
sunflowers, which grow here among the spartina in restricted areas, covering
a few acres in the middle of the marsh! They sit, several on one
plant, as close together as the branches and their weight allow. We
draw nearer, until we are within twenty yards of the assembly. The
birds must see us, but do not mind, and we have excellent opportunity
to watch them. Their numbers are still swelling. The long, narrow,
ridge-like stretch of sunflowers is filling up more and more. From
the north comes a steady flow of Eaves, all bound for the convention.</p>

<p>It is now 6 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>; the influx of arrivals from the north has ceased,
and all seem ready for the opening of the session; but they do not look
as if they were going to transact important business. Some fly up from
time to time, draw a few circles and sit down again. Most of them
look tired, as if they had already performed a most fatiguing task.
The majority are young fellows, all Eaves, in pale attire, some so small
as if not fully grown; but there are also many adults in high dress
among them. All are enjoying their rest, some are preening their
feathers, others half close their eyes and puff up their plumage, as if
going to sleep. There are still some high up in the ether enjoying
their enviable wing power; others are hunting low over the marsh, in
company with Whitebreasts.</p>

<p>Although the two species hunt, fly and roost together, they do
not hold their meetings together. The Whitebreasts' assemblages are
held over water. They betake themselves to a pond or lake, and
find a perch on the pods, stalks and projecting leaves of the lotus
(<i>Nelumbo lutea</i>), with which some of these shallow waters of the
marsh are literally covered. There is a small pond only a quarter
of a mile from the sunflower patch, and this is now just full of
Whitebreasts. Now and then a little cloud of them rises from the
pond, and after a few evolutions settles down again. There are only
a few hundred; the height of their autumnal wandering is several
weeks behind that of the Eaves. These are most numerous in late
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">-&#8239;119&#8239;-</a></span>
August and early September; but, as their number decreases, that of the
Whitebreasts increases, reaching the height at the time the Eaves depart.</p>

<p>In summer the roost belongs almost entirely to the Eaves, who
flock here from the surrounding country. So do the Roughwings, a
few hundred only, and some Barn Swallows and Whitebreasts, which
two species are not numerous breeders in this region.</p>

<span class="smaller">Photographed from nature by Frank M. Chapman, Leonia, N. J., August, 1897</span></span>
</div>

<p>As soon as migration begins, about the middle of August, the
Eaves are greatly reinforced, and for the next four weeks enormous
numbers are present, but it is probable that they are not always the
same individuals, as their numbers vary from day to day. It seems
they perform their migrations by stages, from roost to roost, employing
mainly the first hour of the morning for their flights, spending
the day resting and feeding in the region surrounding the roost.
The substitution of arriving Whitebreasts for departing Eaves is in
the beginning almost imperceptible, but at last we see that the one
has taken the place of the other entirely. The Roughwings become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">-&#8239;120&#8239;-</a></span>
more numerous in early September, and many remain, with a few
Barn Swallows, into October, but the latter are never conspicuous at
this roost. Martins and Bank Swallows are only accidental visitors
to this roost. The Whitebreasts remain numerous to the middle of
October, and small detachments linger even a week longer.</p>

<p>Most of the Eaves that have been gathering on the sunflowers
before 6 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> are still there at 8 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, and the Whitebreasts are also
on the lotus yet; but an hour later, when the sun has heated the
marsh and started the winged insects on their aërial mission, the time
for activity has arrived, and the meetings are adjourned, the birds
dispersed. We, too, will adjourn, with the promise to be back for
another meeting in the evening. When migration is well under way,
the collecting of the Eaves and Whitebreasts begins early in the
evening; in fact, large droves are met at all hours of the day, playfully
gyrating in the blue heavens above, or describing endless curves
upon the glittering marsh beneath. The Roughwings are seldom
seen in the marsh in daytime. As soon as they leave the roost at
early dawn, they hurry away to their accustomed haunts along the
water courses in the timber, where they collect on the branches of a
dead tree on the bank, if possible over water. There they sit, soon
after daybreak, fifty to one hundred together, silent and lost in meditation,
patiently awaiting the dissipation of the vapory dimness, the
signal for activity. They are greatly attached to these meeting-places,
and resort to them often in daytime as well as in the evening.
Indeed, these gatherings of Roughwings on certain dead trees
along our woodland lakes and streams are quite a feature of the
landscape from July till October. Often their ranks are considerably
swelled by an admixture of other Swallows&mdash;oftenest the Bank Swallows,
who join them on their entomologizing excursions, and find it
congenial to spend some time on the same perch with their gentle
cousins.</p>

<p>In fall migration, the different kinds of Swallows like to mix,
hunt and rest together, and it is nothing rare to find four or five
species sitting side by side. To be sure of a full view of the whole
performance, we are in the marsh as early as 5 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, and take a
stand west of the roost to have a good light, and also to be in a
position where we can overlook part of Maple Lake, over which a
large number of Swallows take their way. Indeed, we find them
already plentiful, and watch their actions. A few dozens are sitting
on the plant stalks projecting from the water, mostly Whitebreasts.
From the west comes a pretty steady stream of Eaves. When they
reach the spot where the Whitebreasts are gathering now, they pause
a moment, and, hovering, take a drink, several at once, after which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">-&#8239;121&#8239;-</a></span>
they continue their course. Is it not strange that they seem to
think that this is the only place for Eaves to drink, though the lake
is half a mile long?</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/pg_121.png" width="406" height="146" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">'BIRD NOTES'&mdash;TREE SWALLOWS<br />
<span class="smaller">Photographed from nature by Frank M. Chapman</span></span>
</div>

<p>Bobolinks also arrive in the marsh; small parties pass over,
and their <i>pink</i> is often in the air. It is now 5.30 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> More Eaves
come, drink, and move on. We move, too, following them through
the high spartina until we see in the distance an oasis of black
dots in the yellow sea of grasses. While we are still advancing, a
Pigeon Hawk darts over our heads, going straight for the oasis.
In less than no time the black dots take wing and up goes the
whole congregation of Eaves, up, up, scattering to all winds, and
disappearing for several minutes. But the disturber is gone, and
the frightened birds find courage to return and sit down again on
their favorite weeds, from which they can overlook the marsh for
miles around.</p>

<p>The Bobolinks, for whose special benefit the Hawk's visit was
this time meant, are still hovering in the air, but new troops arrive,
and after some aimless drifting all settle down to roost amongst the
grasses.</p>

<p>The sun is down now, and perfect streams of Swallows are flowing
from all sides toward the oasis in the center. This is the moment
when the Whitebreasts, who for the last hour have been congregating
on the lotus of the neighboring lakes, mingle with the
passing Eaves and accompany them to the common roost. The
Roughwings, too, have left their haunts and are appearing in the
marsh.</p>

<p>The light of day is waning fast, and the smoky air gets dim and
misty. The assembled Eaves are now seen to rise in clouds from
their oasis, mix their forces with the invading army, and the grandest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">-&#8239;122&#8239;-</a></span>
spectacle ensues. At first it looks as if confusion reigned, but soon
the hosts of fleet-winged birds no longer whirl aimlessly through
space. All mass and muster, and perform strange evolutions with
amazing swiftness and precision. Now we see them scattering and
spreading over the whole area on which they intend to roost, apparently
to make sure that no danger lurks beneath the grasses. Here
they come, skimming, almost touching, the spartina, pass by, and
speed onward until lost to sight for a few moments, when all at
once a great cloud of moving specks is visible in the distant
sky. The specks are Swallows, and the cloud has life; it moves, it
rolls, it swells, it comes, it breaks and, like a torrent of wing-borne
arrows, darts upon us, scattering and spreading out, as it descends
for another wild dash low over the spartina.</p>

<p>The same wonderful maneuvers repeat themselves as long as
the evening twilight lasts, and, though with each descent the cloud
does shrink in size, it does not cease to rise again until black night
has fully settled down, and even after dark small droves of bewildered
birds rush madly by our side. Being well within the range
of the now settled birds, we cannot go away without disturbing some
in their repose; although they are dispersed over a large area, every
now and then one will be seen to scamper out and vanish in the
darkness.</p>

</div>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">S</span>ince I printed, in 'The Auk' (Vol. vi, p. 1), a description
of the Bittern's vocal performances, I have witnessed
a repetition of them on three occasions; and the
story of my successes, such as they are, may be encouraging
to the younger readers of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>.</p>

<p>The remarkable sounds, sometimes likened to those
of an old-fashioned wooden pump, sometimes to those
made by a man driving a stake in wet soil (and the likeness is
unmistakable, not to say perfect, in both cases), must have attracted
attention, we may suppose, ever since the settlement of the country.
The dullest person could not hear them, it would seem, without
wondering how and by what they were produced. But up to the
time of my 'Auk' article, there was only one authentic record, so
far as I am aware, that the bird had ever been seen in the act of
uttering them. For my own part, having never lived near a meadow
adapted to the Bittern's purposes, I had never so much as heard his
famous 'boom,' though references to it here and there, in the writings
of Thoreau especially, had given me a lively desire to do so.
It was a strange accident, surely, that the first Bittern I had ever
heard should show himself so openly and for so long a time. Beginners'
luck, we may call it, and be thankful that such providential
encouragements are not so very uncommon. As the Scripture says,
"The last shall be first."</p>

<p>On the 2d of May, 1889, a year after the observations recorded
in 'The Auk' article, I was lying upon a cliff on the edge of a cat-tail
swamp, listening for Rail notes or a Least Bittern's <i>coo</i>, when a
Bittern, very much to my surprise, pumped almost at my feet. By
good luck a small wooded peninsula jutted into the swamp just at
that point (the swamp, I regret to say, has since been converted into
a town reservoir), and, keeping in the shelter of rocks and trees,
I stole out to its very tip unobserved. Two or three times the notes
were repeated, but I could get no sight of the performer. Then, all
in a flash, he stood before me&mdash;as no doubt he had been doing all
the while&mdash;in full view, just across a narrow space of open water
against a patch of cat-tails. He had taken no alarm, and pumped
six or eight times while I stood, opera-glass in hand, watching his
slightest motion. Then he stalked away into the reeds, pumped
twice,&mdash;behind the scenes, as it were,&mdash;and fell silent.</p>

<p>Two days later I went to the Wayland meadows, where I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">-&#8239;124&#8239;-</a></span>
seen my bird of the year previous, and there, seated upon the railroad
embankment, as before, I watched a Bittern pump at short intervals
for more than an hour. Most of the time he was more or less
hidden by the low grass, through which he was slowly traveling down
the meadow; but once, coming near the remains of a last year's
haycock, he went a little out of his way, mounted it, and boomed in
full sight. The Bittern is a wader and a recluse, but once in a while,
it appears, he has no objection to a clear platform and dry feet.</p>

<p>I felt myself highly favored. Twice within three days I had been
admitted to "assist" at mysteries of which Thoreau, who spent his life
in the best of Bittern country, had never obtained so much as a
glimpse.</p>

<p>Exactly a year afterward (May 4, 1890) I was strolling along a
road near home, when from a meadow beside it came the now
familiar pumping notes. I made toward the spot, and by the help
of a clump of alder bushes approached within a very short distance
of the bird, who stood in short grass, quite unconcealed. A migratory
visitor only, he must have been, for I am certain that no Bittern
ever summered in that place during my years of residence near it.
I watched him at his work till I was tired. Then, bethinking myself
of a friend and neighbor who knew nothing about birds, but had
once expressed to me a curiosity about the 'Stake-driver,' I walked
to the village, rang his doorbell, and invited him to go back with
me to see the show. The showman was still rehearsing, and we stole
upon him without difficulty, and saw as much as we wished of his
doings. Though it was Sunday morning, and the bird was as serious
as any parson, we took the liberty of laughing a little at his absurd
contortions.</p>

<p>Since then I have heard the Bittern's music on sundry occasions,
but never have found it possible to come within sight of him in
the act of making it. Once, I remember, I was sitting upon a roadside
fence, reading, when a carriage stopped and an unrecognized
feminine voice said: "Do you see that Heron behind you, Mr. Torrey?"
The "Heron" was <i>Botaurus lentiginosus</i>, in a bit of low ground
close by a house. I shut my book and gave him my attention,
which he presently rewarded by catching and swallowing a snake.
This was in autumn, when Bitterns, like lesser birds, are liable to
turn up in unexpected quarters. The reader may take the incident,
if he will, as a warning against the reading of print out of doors.
As a general thing, we may safely say, Nature's page is better than
a book.</p>

<p>One season a friend and myself became much interested in the
question as to the relative 'carrying power' of the three notes or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">-&#8239;125&#8239;-</a></span>
syllables of which the Bittern's music is composed. The discussion
began by our hearing a single far-away note, repeated at the proper
intervals, at a time when we could not well follow it up. Later investigation,
to our no small surprise, compelled us to settle down upon
the conclusion that the first note was the one last to be lost as we
traveled away from the bird. We were surprised, I say, for the
second note is the one which bears, or seems to bear, the accent.
<i>Plum-pud-d'n</i>, the creature appears to say, with an emphasis fairly to
be called violent upon the middle note. Why, then, should not
the middle note be heard farthest? What <i>is</i> emphasis, anyhow,
if not, as the dictionary says, a "special force of voice." Could there
be something peculiar, we asked ourselves, in the <i>quality</i> of the first
syllable, which made it carry beyond the others? We discussed the
matter eagerly, trudging to and fro to make certain of the fact itself,
and agreed, if I remember rightly, upon a plausible explanation. As
I review the case, however, I am so much in doubt as to the correctness
of our theory that it seems quite as well not to state it, but to
leave the question to any <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> reader who may some day have
nothing better to do than to investigate it for himself.</p>

</div>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">It</span> has always been our experience that young bird students who
have just crossed the threshold of ornithology are glad to
turn for a word of advice and assistance to their older
brethren, who have already made some progress in the
science; and it has always been a pleasure for us to give
such aid. In view of these facts, we take this opportunity
of offering a few words of counsel for the benefit of those
who are beginning the study of birds.</p>

<p>Doubtless every beginner looks upon the formation of a collection
as necessarily the first step on the ornithological ladder; and probably
a collection of eggs is preferred to a collection of birds, because the
specimens can be prepared much more readily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">-&#8239;126&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p>Soon you meet complaints from well meaning persons who object
to robbing birds' nests, and you reply that you are collecting for
scientific purposes. Very good; science has need of you all, but
do you know what scientific ornithology&mdash;real ornithology&mdash;is?</p>

<p>Are you not influenced, to some extent, at least, by "o&ouml;logical"
magazines and dealers' price-lists of eggs, from which you learn that
it is important to secure <i>series of sets</i>,&mdash;which means hundreds and
thousands of eggs,&mdash;and wherein you also learn the market price of
this or that egg, and value your specimens accordingly,&mdash;just as you
do your postage stamps? This is not science, and the men who advocate
this sort of collecting, and who have the largest collections of
eggs, rarely contribute anything to our knowledge of birds, and are
not advancing the science of ornithology.</p>

<p>If you must have a collection, a few sets of eggs (often a single
set) of each species of bird will answer all your purposes. There is
nothing to be gained by the collecting of a series, except the extermination
of the birds, which is surely not your object.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is a vast amount of bird work that you
can do to help the science of ornithology and gain a reputation for
yourself.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of facts regarding the distribution of birds,
their habits, etc., which are still unknown, and you should make it
your aim to become an authority on the birds of your region, and
keep records of all your observations as to migration, habits, abundance,
etc. You will find ample opportunity for work, as every year
will bring to light new facts, and the more you contribute to our
knowledge of the birds the more you will see what an insignificant
matter the formation of an egg collection is in comparison with real
ornithology.</p>

<p>In the case of birds, it is justifiable to shoot specimens which
are new to you for purposes of identification, but you should make
the best use of the bird <i>before</i> you kill it, so that it will not be
necessary to shoot more of the same kind in order to tell what they
are. Your aim should be to learn to recognize birds at sight and
by their notes, and you will find you will learn more of value by a
study of the living bird than by collecting skins.</p>

<p>The exact knowledge that we now possess of the coloration, etc.,
of North American birds, and the large collections available for study
in the museums, render it entirely unnecessary for <i>every</i> bird student
to form a collection. Those who undertake any special line of study
will soon learn what specimens are required and collect accordingly,
instead of amassing a large number of specimens with no particular
object in view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">-&#8239;127&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p>These suggestions are not made with a faultfinding or sentimental
feeling, but in a friendly spirit, for the purpose of counteracting
the effect of the advice of egg dealers and traders, who seem bent
upon developing our budding students into "egg hogs" instead of
ornithologists.</p>

<p>We have all killed birds and collected eggs, but not to a useless
excess, and have always, we believe, made real use of our collections
in adding to the knowledge of birds and advancing the science of
ornithology.</p>

<p>As active members of the American Ornithologists' Union, we are
only too glad to encourage the study of birds and aid the beginner, but
unless some steps be taken against this useless egg collecting, the extermination
of some at least of our birds will soon be effected.</p>

<p>We ask your earnest consideration of these points, and trust you
will aid us by your influence and example in advancing true ornithology,
and in discouraging the waste of bird-life occasioned by this
"fad" of egg collecting.</p>

<div class="dropcap">E</div>
<p class="p0">arly each spring I watch for the return of a Ph&oelig;be
bird, which usually gladdens my heart by his appearance
about sundown of some bright day. He
is alone, because, according to most authorities, he travels
in advance of his mate; and when I ask with wonder,
"Well Peter, where is Ph&oelig;be?" with a quick dip of his tail
and an expressive twitter, he seems to say, "She will arrive
on the next train."</p>

<p>For several years they have returned to the same nest beneath
the roof of my veranda, each spring re-lining the inside and brightening
the outside with green moss. They always raise two broods.
They are very tame, and from year to year do not seem to forget
their confidence of the previous summer, and will perch on the cedar
tree close to the porch, or light on the rope of the hammock only a
few feet away from me.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 257px;">
<img src="images/pg_130b.png" width="257" height="218" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">'ZIP'</span>
</div>

<p>I have so trained my cat, Zip, that she thinks it is as wicked to
look at a bird as she does to climb on the table, and never does
either. Peter and Ph&oelig;be seemed to know that they had nothing to fear
from her; and, when sitting on the little white eggs, their bright eyes
would peep over the nest at Zip, sitting or napping in the easy chair
below. When the young birds arrived, the parents would fly back
and forth feeding them, without showing any more fear of the cat
than they did of me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">-&#8239;131&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p>While busy in the house one day, my attention was attracted by
a loud tapping at the window, and on looking up I saw Ph&oelig;be
apparently in great distress. She would fly at the window, striking
the glass with her bill, circle round, fly back again, and tap, as
though trying to attract my attention. Upon my appearance at the
door, she flew toward the nest and, pausing on the wing, as a Kingfisher
will poise over the water when seeing a fish, uttered sharp
cries, fluttering her wings all the while, and telling me in bird language
of her trouble. There sat a cat on the chair just below the
nest, but it was not Zip. She had taken no other cat into her confidence,
hence her alarm. When I drove the strange cat away,
she quieted down and administered to the wants of her family as
usual.</p>

<p>This little incident seems to show that birds become so accustomed
to their environments that they know each member of the
family, even to the dog and cat, and that they possess a certain
degree of reasoning power.</p>

<p>One day later in the season, when they were raising the second
family, my attention was again attracted by the same cries. A pair
of my tame Pigeons, looking for a place to build, had lighted on
the cornice over the door not far from the nest, and both Peter and
Ph&oelig;be were trying to drive them away. They would dart almost
up to them, all the while snapping their bills vigorously, as though
catching a succession of insects, but before the Pigeons could strike
with their wings, would dart away, and like a flash be back again.
They did not seem to be calling on me for assistance, but were
themselves fighting for what they considered their rights, and evidently
did not think Pigeons "as harmless as Doves." The warfare
continued at intervals for several days, until the Pigeons decided it
was an unpleasant locality for a future home, and retired to the
barn.</p>

<p class="caption3">Birds Through a Telescope</p>

<p>The season is approaching when the
migration of birds may be studied to
advantage through a telescope. A 2-inch
hand glass may be used, though a
higher power is preferable. It should be
focused on the moon, across the surface
of which the bird is seen passing.</p>

<p>September 3, 1887, at Tenafly, N. J.,
Mr. John Tatlock, Jr., and myself, using a
6<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-inch equatorial, saw 262 birds cross
the moon's disc between the hours of
eight and eleven (The Auk, V, p. 37), and
we have since repeated the observation.</p>

<p>Studies of this nature should throw
much light on the question of 'highways of
migration,' and at the same time furnish
an idea of the number of birds passing
through a given space during a given time;
and, more particularly, they should tell us
the height at which birds perform their
nocturnal journeys.</p>

<p>Mr. Tatlock and myself solved this
latter problem by a hypothetical assumption
of the inferior and superior distances
at which a bird would be visible. In this
way we arrived at the conclusion that the
birds seen were between one and three
miles above the earth.</p>

<p>Until recently this theory has lacked
confirmation, but I now learn from Dr.
William R. Brooks, Director of Smith
Observatory, at Geneva, N. Y., that
during the evening of May 23, 1899, while
observing the moon through his 10<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>-inch
refracting telescope, using a power of 100
diameters, he saw some forty birds cross
the field of vision. Dr. Brooks states that
from the distinctness of the image and the
fact that from three to five seconds were
required by each bird to cross the segment
of the moon in the field of the
telescope, he estimates the birds to have
been distant about seven and a half miles,
and further calculation, based on this
estimate, places them about two miles
above the earth.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Frank M. Chapman.</span></p>


<p class="caption3">The Cardinal in Maine</p>

<p>This incident is vouched for by Mrs. L.
M. N. Stevens, National President of the
W C. T. U.</p>

<p>Several years ago, after the first snowfall
at Stroudwater, Maine, Mr. Stevens
hurried into the house one morning to ask
his wife to come and see a handsome, but
cold and hungry-looking, red bird, in a
shrub near the door. Mrs. Stevens saw
that it was a Cardinal Grosbeak, and,
placing some food in a large cage, she set
it near the bush. The Cardinal soon
hopped inside, and was safely convoyed
indoors under cover of a blanket. A
happy season began. He was given the
freedom of the room, and became very
tame and companionable.</p>

<p>In the spring, as soon as the red bird
grew restless and the weather mild, he
was let loose, and flew away.</p>

<p>In the fall, with the first cold snap,
came the Cardinal, to spend his second
winter in the old home.</p>

<p>Again in the spring, when the restlessness
re-appeared, Mrs. Stevens wanted to
let the bird fly, but yielded to the judgment
of her husband, who advised delay,
lest cold and hunger overtake the little wayfarer.
Nature, however, avenged the
violation of instinct; in a few days the
Cardinal drooped, refused to avail himself
of liberty, and died.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ella Gilbert

<p class="caption3">A Useful Bird</p>

<p>In speaking of the economic value of certain
of our birds, a lecturer, quoting Professor
Beal, said that in Iowa the Tree
Sparrow was estimated to destroy 875 tons
of the seeds of noxious weeds annually.</p>

<p>As reported in a local paper, this statement
read: "The Tree or Chipping Sparrow
destroyed, as discovered by scientific
observation, 640,000 tons of the eggs and
young of harmful insects."</p>

<p>In this book, Mr. Kearton and his

as well as their field of work,
are inexhaustible. It differs from 'With
Nature and a Camera' chiefly in being
addressed more especially to photographers,
the opening chapters being devoted
to a description of the outfit required,
with practical suggestions as to its use.
These are followed by chapters on 'Birds,'
'Mammals', 'Insects,' and the life of
'Pond, River and Seashores.' The
illustrations are fully up to the standard
of previous work by the same authors,
which we have before had occasion to
praise so highly, and continued experience
with a camera leads us to appreciate
more fully than ever the truly marvellous
pictures they have secured. <a href="#Photographing_Shy">Mr. Kearton's
paper</a> in this number of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> admirably
illustrates the practicability of
his advice to naturalist-photographers,
who, in 'Wild Life at Home' will find
both instruction and encouragement. The
book should be in every naturalist's
library, whether or not he uses a camera.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Birds.</span> By <span class="smcap">Annie M. Grant</span>. Report of the R. I. Board
of Agriculture, 1899.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Birds of Ontario, in Relation to Agriculture.</span> By
<span class="smcap">Chas. W. Nash, Ontario Department of Agriculture, Toronto</span>.</p>

<p>In Mrs. Grant's paper we have an
epitome of a great amount of useful information.
The horticultural and agricultural
societies are doing a good work in
publishing such papers in their reports,
thus ensuring to them a wide circulation
among the class who most need this kind of
literature.</p>

<p>In that portion of her paper devoted to
the 'Decrease in Bird-life,' Mrs. Grant
puts her finger on some very sore spots.
There can be no doubt that much harm
has been done through egg-collecting by
pseudo-naturalists, who make no use of
their collections except to boast of their
size and rarity, and who gather thousands
of extra sets for purposes of exchange.
Another element of bird destruction is
seen in the South, where our common
singing birds are so generally offered for
sale in the market as food. A campaign
of education is needed here. The time
wasted in shooting these useful creatures
would, if properly applied, produce more
and better meat in the shape of domestic
poultry, or other equally palatable food.
We hope Mrs. Grant will continue her
good work.</p>

<p>In Mr. Nash's paper we have another
concise statement of the facts with regard
to the usefulness of birds from an
agricultural point of view. The case of
the birds of prey is very clearly and forcibly
presented. When these birds do
harm&mdash;as when they pick up a stray
chicken&mdash;the evil is open and apparent
to everybody; but the good work they
are constantly doing is only appreciated
after the most careful and systematic observation.
The depredations of the vast
hordes of small mammals is a constant
menace to the interests of husbandry,
and more especially to horticulture.
Without question, the Hawks and Owls
are the most efficient checks upon the increase
of these creatures, and it cannot
be too often or too forcibly impressed
upon the farmers that these birds should
be rigorously protected.</p>

<p>With regard to the other birds, the
case is equally well put, and illustrated
by many interesting and valuable observations
and experiments. There can be
no question that this is a valuable paper,
and that it deserves a wide circulation
among agricultural people.</p>

<p>As to the merits of the illustrations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">-&#8239;134&#8239;-</a></span>
with which it is embellished, there may

<p>This is a contribution to the class of

evidence of sympathy with his subject.
The illustrations include an admirable
frontispiece of Chickadees by Louis
Fuertes, thirteen full-page half-tones,
for the most part illustrating the localities
described, and numerous half-tone
'thumb-nail pictures' in the text, largely
taken from mounted birds. Some of the
latter are effective; others are too small or
too indistinct to be of value to those who
would need them.</p>

<p>As long as man's attitude toward nature
is the standpoint of dollars and cents,
bird-lovers will welcome every fact which
places them in possession of a fresh argument
to be used where appeals to sentiment
are of no avail. It is, therefore,
with great satisfaction that we receive these
sound, convincing papers on economic
zo&ouml;logy.</p>

<p>Dr. Palmer's paper has long been
needed and, fortunately or unfortunately,
so unanswerable are the facts which he
presents, that one would imagine universal
knowledge of them would be all that was
necessary to avert further danger from
the introduction of exotic species. The
subject, however, should receive the
prompt attention of legislators, in order
that it may be duly placed under the
control of the proper authorities&mdash;obviously
the officials of the Biologic Survey
of the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>In giving us the results of his studies
of the food of certain seed-eating birds,
Dr. Judd at the same time places their
economic importance so far beyond dispute
that we trust every agriculturist in
the land may become familiar with his
facts and figures. None of the many
valuable papers issued by the Biological
Survey has had a more obvious value
than this one.</p>

<p>In his lecture before the New Jersey
Horticultural Society, Professor Beal discusses
unprejudicedly birds' power for
good or evil. He shows that while insects,
especially certain noxious species,
have greatly increased since the settlement
of this country, birds have decreased,
and that in order to restore the balance
disturbed by man, an increase in the
number of our birds is greatly to be
desired.&mdash;F. M. C.</p>


<p class="caption3">Book News</p>

<p>Every lover of animals must rejoice in
the phenomenal success achieved by Ernest
Seton Thompson's 'Wild Animals I have
Known.' Although published only last
October, over 14,000 copies have been
sold, and the book's popularity increases
as its charm becomes more widely known.
Mr. Thompson has done more to bridge
the gap between human life and animal
life than any writer we have known.
One has only to read his work to become
convinced of one's kinship with
the lower forms of life.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<p>The advice of a prominent ornithologist
to beginners to collect all the birds of a
species they can get, has so long misrepresented
the necessities of the case and,
at the same time, brought legitimate collecting
into disrepute, that every one having
the interests of the science of ornithology
at heart will read with great satisfaction
the circular entitled 'Hints to Young Bird
Students' which we reprint on <a href="#Hints_to_Young_Bird_Students">another
page</a>. Signed by a majority of the professional
ornithologists of this country,
representing the institutions where ornithology
is most actively studied, it may be
accepted beyond thought of dispute as
representing the true attitude of scientific
ornithologists toward the question of collecting.
And in place of the advice to
kill all the birds "you can get," what do
we find? Virtually a plea to abstain from
all egg-collecting, to take birds only for
purposes of identification, and a statement
that the student "will learn more of
value by a study of the living bird than
by collecting skins."</p>

<p>To our mind, the importance of this
circular cannot be over-rated. It marks
an epoch in the history of North American
ornithology. The future ornithologist is
not to be a mere hoarder of birds' skins,
but a student of bird-life whose researches,
we predict, will prove an invaluable aid in
the solution of that most difficult and most
important of all biologic problems, the
relation of animals to their environment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> paper by Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller
on '<a href="#On_the_Ethics_of_Caging_Birds">The Ethics of Caging Birds</a>,' published
in the last number of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>,
has been both commended and condemned.
Some correspondents have considered it a
most rational and unprejudiced treatment
of the subject, others have written that as
its general tenor might encourage the caging
of birds, it was not to be endorsed.
Particularly do they deplore what Mrs.
Miller feels to be "a work of charity,"&mdash;the
rescuing of birds "from the discomforts
of a bird-store" for, they say, that
the dealer replaces the sold bird with
another, and the final result is to encourage
the trade in birds. Of this there can be
no doubt, and the question, therefore,
becomes one for debate, as to whether the
pleasure to be derived from the companionship
of a caged bird, the humanizing influence
which may be exerted by association
with a creature dependent on us, and
the knowledge we may acquire of its habits,
justify us in depriving it of its liberty&mdash;assuming,
of course, that it receives
proper care. We shall be glad to receive
the opinions of our readers on this subject.</p>

<p class="caption3">The Responsibility of the Audubon
Society</p>

<p>Now that the Audubon Society is recognized
as a factor in the higher civilization
of the day, it may be well to ask how
far it realizes its responsibility as a public
educator.</p>

<p>"For the Protection of Birds," is a
most reasonable and tangible declaration
of motive, but what next?</p>

<p>The male and female public is straightway
asked to give up certain habits that
it has regarded as inherent rights,&mdash;in
the cause of humanity and agricultural
economy.</p>

<p>So far so good; but should not these
would-be teachers of good will to animals,
themselves be educated in consistent
humanity, in order to keep their
doctrines above the ridicule level?</p>

<p>Upon the discrimination of its humanity
depends the future of the Audubon
Society. A discrimination that shall
render its workings logical, and make it
able to see that it must at least give as
much as it takes. A breadth of knowledge
to realize that if the Society restricts
the hat trimmings of women, the egg-collecting
habits of boys, and the "just to
see if I can hit it" proclivities of both
boys and men, it is bound to give them
something beside "the consciousness of
rectitude" in return. The very least it
can do is to help them to become as intimately
acquainted with "the bird in the
bush" as they were with the egg in the
pocket and the feather on the hat.</p>

<p>It is here that the educational responsibility
of the Audubon Society lies. Instead
of issuing tracts simply to decry
feather-wearing, and to say that something
should be done, I would have each
Society send out one or more illustrated
bird lectures to the remoter corners of
its range, where people do not have
the privilege of hearing professional ornithologists.
Also to the groups of remote
country schools whose scholars have no
"key to the fields" that lie so close at
hand. I would have the Societies send
small circulating libraries of bird books in
the same way. To introduce people to the
bird in the bush is the way to create a
public sentiment to keep it there, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">-&#8239;137&#8239;-</a></span>
make it possible to obtain legislative authority
for the enactment and keeping of
good bird laws, which are the backbone
of protection.</p>

<p>Again, there should be no sort of conflict
between ultra bird protectionists
and legitimate scientific ornithology. That
many of the best known ornithologists
occupying public positions in the United
States favor the restriction of egg-collecting,
etc., is amply proved by a leaflet
issued in May, by Witmer Stone,<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> called
"<a href="#Hints_to_Young_Bird_Students">Hints to Young Bird Students</a>," and
signed by such men as J. A. Allen, Robert
Ridgway, C. Hart Merriam, A. K. Fisher,
Wm. Brewster, F. M. Chapman, John H.
Sage, C. W. Richmond, T. S. Palmer, and
Wm. Dutcher.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>The Audubon Societies are responsible
for meeting these liberal-minded and progressive
scientists half way. There must
be anatomists and embryologists to study
the human body, why not then, also, of
the feathered brotherhood, <i>only</i> it is not
necessary for mankind in general to keep
skeletons of either birds or people in their
closets for this purpose, and the random
collecting of either should be regarded
as equally reprehensible.</p>

<p>I would see humanity and science allied
in this matter. If the Audubon Societies
confess that this is impossible, they are
taking the responsibility of harnessing
humanity with ignorance,&mdash;a horse that
will drag any companion into the ditch.</p>

<p>Let "For the Protection of Birds" be
the banner motto under which the Audubon
Society shall go out, as it is bound,
to teach (not to preach) the 'bird in the
bush,' but the teaching need be none the
less humane, and will be far more effectual
if, instead of 'dicky-bird' platitudes
of uncertain sex and species, it deals out
good, sound, popular ornithology.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="Bird_Restorers"></a>
The So-called Sparrow War in Boston</p>

<p>In the month of March, 1898, a committee
organized by the American Society
of Bird Restorers presented to the Mayor
of Boston in person the following petition,
signed by a host of representative
Bostonians:</p>

<p>"<i>To Hon. Josiah Quincy, Mayor of
Boston.</i></p>

<p class="smaller">"The undersigned petitioners hereby respectfully
represent that the presence in
Boston of hosts of the noxious imported
Finch, known as the English Sparrow, has
come to be a public nuisance, general
expense and serious esthetic injury, imperatively
calling for prompt municipal
abatement.</p>

<p class="smaller">"Your petitioners would, therefore, most
earnestly request that, as the Chief
Executive Officer of the city, you direct
the immediate reduction and suppression
of this pest in such places (instancing the
Common and, conditionally, the cemeteries
of Boston) as may now be under, or may
with this purpose in view be brought
under, municipal control."</p>

<p>Under the law of 1890, the Mayor proceeded
at once to take such measures as
seemed advisable for clearing the Common,
Public Garden, and city squares, of the
Sparrow pest.</p>

<p>The work was done under the general
oversight of the Committee on the English
Sparrow, of which Mr. Fletcher Osgood,
manager and organizer of the Bird
Restorers, was and is the chairman. Five
men, with Foreman Kennedy, proceeded to
clear English Sparrow nests from the
Common, by removing them from orifices
in the trees, from openings in the Sanitary
Building, and from electric hoods.
The nest-boxes, put up years ago by
misguided persons to accommodate the
English Sparrow were all removed, and
the Sanitary Building on the Public
Garden was cleared.</p>

<p>In the progress of this work, thousands
of small orifices in the trees of the Common
(all known to exist) were cleared
out and effectively closed with wooden
stoppers, and much dead wood, inviting
the breeding of the Sparrow, was removed.
As a whole, great good in the
way of arresting decay and generally
improving the trees of the Common was
done by Foreman Kennedy and his force,
even if we leave out of account the
checking of the breeding of the Sparrow.
The work began on March 15, and ended
April 5. During that period about 5,000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">-&#8239;138&#8239;-</a></span>
nests and 1,000 eggs were destroyed. No
young birds were found. The protest
against the work, based mainly on sentimental
grounds, which Mr. Angell, of the
S. P. C. A., put forth, resulted in two
picturesque hearings at the City Hall. An
account of these hearings, with some of
their informal adjuncts, would certainly
entertain and instruct the readers of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>
were it possible to embody it here.</p>

<p>Let it suffice to say, that the weight of
common sense, of real humanity, and of
economics, as well as of science in overwhelming
measure, was, in the judgment
of the best informed, wholly with those
who would reduce the Sparrow. The
Mayor, however, decided to suspend the
work, assigning as a reason the difficulty
and expense of continuing it. The committee
sent to the Mayor a letter expressing
its regret that the work should thus
be brought to an untimely close, and fully
outlining plans for its continuance. At
the present writing, no definite prospect is
in sight of the resumption of the work.
The committee proposed, after the closure
of the nesting orifices, to pull down by
means of hooked poles such nests as were
built by the Sparrows in the branches of
the trees on the Common and Garden,
timing visits so as to destroy nests and
eggs only, thus preventing the hatching
of young. With the onset of cold weather
it was proposed to trap and destroy the
Sparrow by devices which were already
proved at once efficient and merciful.
These two methods, aided, perhaps, by
others, carefully planned to avoid cruelty,
were the ones much relied on by the
committee to do the needed work of
clearance.</p>

<p>After the stoppage of the work the
Mayor wrote to Chairman Osgood, asking
his opinion as to the advisability of putting
up bird-houses on the Common, so built,
without perches, as to keep out the Sparrow
and admit the White-bellied Swallow,
Bluebird and House Wren. Mr. Osgood
replied in effect that perchless bird-houses,
judging from recent evidence, would probably
invite and shelter the breeding of
the Sparrow, and, with the Common still
uncleared, would hardly aid in restoring
any native bird. He was willing, under
certain strict conditions, that the experiment
should be tried purely as an experiment,
provided that every box should be
instantly removed upon proof that these
perchless devices sheltered the Sparrow.
He, however, expressed little hope
that any good would come of such a
measure beyond the absolute demonstration,
once for all, and publicly, that perchless
boxes were not Sparrow-proof. The
"Sparrow committee" could not advise the
putting up of bird-boxes under existing
circumstances, and if any are erected the
responsibility for the trial will not rest in
any way with this committee. At this
writing, the Sparrows shut out from the
tree orifices are building to some extent in
the branches of the trees upon the Common.
To note how extensively this breeding
is carried on this season, and to attain
general information as to the presence of
any native birds upon the Common and
Garden, a patrol of the Boston Branch of
the American Society of Bird Restorers
has been assigned to observation work
through the spring and summer.</p>

<p>Results will be officially reported to the
National Biological Survey (U. S. Department
of Agriculture) at Washington, D. C.</p>

<p class="caption4">MASSACHUSETTS SOCIETY</p>

<p>In February and March, Mr. Ralph
Hoffmann gave a course of eight lectures
on birds, under the auspices of the
Society. These were well attended, and
not only increased the interest in bird
study, but informed the public more fully
of the work of the Society, and also added
materially to the treasury.</p>

<p>March 22nd, the Society held a 'Hat
Show' at the Vendome, which was a success.
Many of the best milliners
exhibited, and it served the purpose
of interesting both milliners and public
in the work of bird protection. In spite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">-&#8239;139&#8239;-</a></span>
of bad weather, the room was crowded all
day, and many hats were sold. The newspapers
reported it with illustrations; the
milliners were pleased; and the Audubon
Society was talked about with renewed
interest.</p>

<p>The Society has purchased the publisher's
stock of the Audubon Calendar
colored plates, without the Calendar numbers,
and are offering them for sale at 25
cents for the set of twelve.</p>

<p>The large sale of the chart is very
satisfactory, about 1,200 having been sold
since Christmas. Appreciative letters are
daily received, and the school teachers
especially commend it.</p>

<p>New circulars have been purchased for
distribution, from the University of Nebraska
and Cornell University; also "A

Wisconsin Society.</p>

<p class="caption4">CONNECTICUT SOCIETY</p>

<p>The second annual meeting of the
society took place on June 1, in the
United Church Chapel, New Haven
Conn., and was largely attended. It being
part of the policy of the Society to hold
its public meetings each year in different
parts of the state.</p>

<p>The president made a short address,
outlining the work for the coming season,
which will include: (1) the consideration
of a practical method for destroying the
English Sparrow, as a bird distinctly
injurious to song birds and others having
agricultural value; (2) an effort to obtain
legislation to stop the spring shooting
of shore and water birds; (3) the addition
to the societies' equipment of several
small libraries of bird books, to be circulated
free throughout the state where
there are no public libraries, after the
manner of the lecture outfits; (4) the
addition of an illustrated lecture suitable
for small children.</p>

<p>The report of the corresponding secretary-treasurer
showed a membership in the
various classes of 814; also, receipts of
over $500 during the year, no debts, and
a balance in the treasury.</p>

<p>The chairman of the committee on free
lectures reported the great success of the
undertaking. The two lectures, "Birds
about Home," by Mrs. Wright, and
"Some Facts about Birds that Concern
the Farmer," by Willard G. Van Name,
having been out over fifty times since
early spring. These lectures, accompanied
by sets of colored slides and oil-lanterns,
are loaned free to any responsible
person within state limits, and the
Granges have lately taken them up with
results most gratifying to the Society.</p>

<p>A few changes were made in the management
as the election of officers. Mrs.
H. S. Glover, the first corresponding secretary
and treasurer, having resigned, received
a hearty vote of thanks for her
work, and Mrs. Wm. Brown Glover was
elected as general secretary in her stead,
Mrs. Howard H. Knapp being elected
treasurer.</p>

<p>The event of the meeting was the lecture
by Mr. F. M. Chapman, upon Photography
as an Aid to Bird Study, all
the beautifully colored slides used as
illustrations having been photographed
from life.</p>

<p>The detailed annual report of the Society's
work will be mailed upon application.</p>

<p class="caption4">TENNESSEE SOCIETY</p>

<p>It is with great satisfaction that we
report the organization in the court
house at Ripley on May 26, of the Audubon
Society of the State of Tennessee.
Without the assistance of the southern
states, the work of the northern section
of the country must necessarily be hampered
by the inability to protect the
birds in their winter haunts and during
the migrations.</p>

<p>It is also gratifying to note the common
sense basis upon which the society
is founded, the president, having stated in
his initial address, that "the society had
for its leading object the creation of a
public opinion that would secure legislation
in the interest of bird protection, that
would spare our birds from threatened
extinction."</p>

<p>In preparing this Manual, it has been the author's aim to propose, within the comprehension
of grammar school pupils, a few of the problems which arise in a thoughtful
study of nature, and to offer suggestions designed to lead to their solution.</p>

<p>That pupils need some rational and definite directions in nature study, all are generally
agreed. But to prepare the outlines and suggestive directions necessary, and to
place these within the reach of each pupil, is more than any ordinary teacher has time
to do, even granting that she is fully prepared for such work. The utter futility of
depending upon oral suggestions during the class hour, when the pupils are supposed to
be doing individual work, is easily apparent on a moment's reflection. With a manual of
directions in hand, each pupil may be made strictly responsible for a certain amount of
work, either in the field or in the laboratory. This removes all occasion for that interruption
in his work, which is, otherwise, due to the pupil's attempt to <i>think</i> and at the
same time <i>hear</i> what the teacher says.</p>

<p>"Practical, complete, and, all in all, is the best manual we know to fit the student to
do really effective science work in the high school&#8230;. Altogether both teacher
and pupils who use this book are to be congratulated, for we are sure that through its
use the whole field of nature study will assume new definiteness, practicality and
interest."</p>

<p class="tdr">

<p>"It is decidedly practical, and will be welcomed by many teachers who wish to respond
in an intelligent way to the demand for nature study."</p>

<p class="caption2">The American Ornithologists' Union</p>

<p class="caption3">BY J. A. ALLEN</p>

<p class="caption4">(First President of the Union)</p>


<div class="fig_left" style="width: 158px;">
<img src="images/pg_143.png" width="158" height="104" alt="D" />
</div>

<p><span class="hidden">D</span>uring the sixteen years that have passed since
the founding of the American Ornithologists'
Union, in August, 1883, the study of North
American birds has advanced with constantly
accelerated strides. That this progress has been due largely
to the founding of the Union is beyond denial, as will
become evident from the following brief history of its work and
the causes that led to its formation.</p>

<p>In all lines of human endeavor, the union of kindred interests and
individual effort toward a common end is the key to success. Before
the founding of the American Ornithologists' Union, its nucleus existed
in a local organization of bird students in Cambridge, known as
the Nuttall Ornithological Club. At first its meetings were informal,
and its membership was limited to a few individuals living in the
immediate vicinity of Cambridge. Later it became regularly organized
as a club, with both resident and corresponding members, the latter
embracing most of the leading ornithologists of this country. The
papers presented at its meetings were often of permanent value, and
were later published in scientific journals. In 1876 these had
become sufficiently numerous and important to warrant the club in
establishing its own medium of publication, the first number bearing
date April, 1876, with the title 'Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological
Club.' As years passed it served not only as the official organ
of the club, but as a medium of communication between American
ornithologists at large.</p>

<p>This led to the consideration of the desirability of organizing a
national society of ornithologists as a means of bringing the workers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">-&#8239;144&#8239;-</a></span>
in this field into more intimate association and more thoroughly consolidating
their interests. The advantages of such consolidation
seemed so evident that a call was issued August 1, 1883, dated Cambridge
and Washington, for "a convention of American Ornithologists,
to be held in New York city, beginning September 26, 1883."
The call was signed by the editor of the 'Nuttall Bulletin' (J. A.
Allen), associate editor of the 'Nuttall Bulletin' (Elliott Coues), and
the president of the Nuttall Club (William Brewster). The response
to the call, sent to forty-eight of the more prominent ornithologists of
the United States and Canada, was most cordial; twenty-five expressed
their intention to attend the convention, and twenty-one were
actually present, including several who came a thousand miles or
more to attend the convention. Not only were by-laws adopted and
officers duly elected, but, as will be noticed later, important lines of
work were laid out and assigned to committees, the principle of
co&ouml;peration being applied in a broad sense.</p>

<p>The Nuttall Ornithological Club is still an active and widely
known organization, although upon the founding of the Union, it
generously voted to discontinue its 'Bulletin' and to place its subscription
list and good will at the service of the Union, which was
already considering the desirability of establishing an official medium
of publication. As a result, the 'Nuttall Bulletin' became 'The
Auk,' which, in recognition of the generous action of the Nuttall
Club, was officially designated as the <i>second series</i> of the 'Nuttall
Bulletin.'</p>

<p>Between isolated workers in any field, jealousies and misunderstandings
arise which personal contact tends to obliterate. Such was the
case with our ornithologists for some years prior to the founding of
the Union. There were two rival check-lists of North American
birds, each perhaps equally authoritative though differing in important
details, which led to confusion, and a tendency to array our
ornithologists into two somewhat hostile camps. This being recognized
as a threatening evil of considerable gravity, one of the first
acts of the Union was to appoint a committee on the Classification
and Nomenclature of North American Birds, so constituted as to
include the most competent authorities on the subject and at the
same time safeguard all conflicting interests. The work of this committee
long since became a matter of history. It was conducted with
the utmost conscientiousness and care; personal interests and personal
bias were generously waived, differences of opinion were settled by
appeal to facts and the evidence, with a result that agreement was
established in respect to all points of nomenclature and other technicalities,
and a new impetus given to systematic investigation. Thus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">-&#8239;145&#8239;-</a></span>
through the work of this committee alone one of the primary objects
in view in founding the Union was most happily accomplished. Not
only a new check-list of North American birds was substituted for
all previous check-lists, but a new 'Code of Nomenclature' was
devised and adopted as the basis for determining the names to be
used in the check-list. After more than two years of work by the
committee the check-list, with its code of nomenclature, was given
to the world in 1886, and became at once the accepted standard of
authority with all American writers on North American birds; the
'Code' included important innovations in respect to certain principles
of nomenclature, which have since become very generally accepted
the world over. It is, therefore, to be regretted that a small faction
has recently arisen in the ranks of the Union, that, objecting to certain
rules of the 'Code,' is seeking to foment a break in the good
feeling and harmony that have marked the last ten or twelve years of
the history of American ornithology.</p>

<p>A second purpose of the Union was, as already intimated, to bring
into co&ouml;peration and into personal acquaintanceship as many as possible
of the workers in ornithology. In effecting this, the appointment
at the first congress of the Union of a Committee on the Migration
of North American Birds proved a most efficient means. This committee,
with Dr. C. Hart Merriam at its head, began at once to issue
circulars of instruction and schedules for the return of data to all
bird observers known to the committee, whether members of the
Union or not. Thousands of circulars were thus issued annually,
reaching hundreds of earnest bird students who had before been
working alone and without contact with the leaders in the science,
who were thus not only stimulated and encouraged to fresh endeavor,
but were placed in communication with a central bureau ever ready
to aid their efforts. In a short time the work of this committee outgrew
the financial resources of the Union, and led to the founding of
a distinct division of the United States Department of Agriculture,
designated the Division of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy,
of which the chairman of this committee was invited to become the
official head, and which has since become the United States Biological
Survey. The data on the migration and geographical distribution
of North American birds gathered by this committee was
turned over to this new Division of the Department of Agriculture
for collation and publication, and the work of collecting further data
was continued on an increased scale by the Chief of the Division of
Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy. This has resulted in the
accumulation of an immense amount of valuable material, but little
of which has as yet been published. In 1888 a preliminary report
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">-&#8239;146&#8239;-</a></span>
on 'Bird Migration in the Mississippi Valley,' prepared by Prof. W.
W. Cooke and Mr. Otto Widmann, under the direction of the chief
of the division, was published, forming one of the most important
contributions to the subject of bird migration that has yet appeared.
A second report on 'The Land Birds of the Pacific District,' by Mr.
Lyman Belding, was published in 1890, and, though issued by the
California Academy of Sciences, was the outcome of the work of this
committee. Eventually all of the vast accumulation of data inaugurated
by the Union, and later carried on under the auspices of the
United States Department of Agriculture, relating not only to the
migratory movements of birds but to their distribution, will doubtless
be published, with proper map and other graphic illustrations.</p>

<p>To another important committee appointed at the first congress
of the Union was delegated the investigation of 'The Status of the
European House Sparrow in America.' This committee issued circulars
of inquiry, and made an elaborate preliminary report to the
Union, which report was later, as in the case of the data accumulated
by the Migration Committee, turned over to the Division of
Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy of the United States Department
of Agriculture. Under Dr. Merriam, the investigation was prosecuted
with renewed activity, and a final and authoritative report was
issued by the Department of Agriculture in 1889. It is needless to
say that this impartially conducted report was strongly condemnatory
of this burdensome pest.</p>

<p>At the second congress of the Union it appointed a Committee
on Protection of North American Birds, which has been continued
to the present time, and has been the guiding influence in this great
economic and humanitarian work. It has done much to arouse and
enlighten public opinion respecting the enormity of the destruction of
birds for millinery purposes, and to guide legislation for the better
protection of our birds. It early published two important 'bulletins'
on the destruction of birds, and was the origin of the original Audubon
Society, whose president, Dr. George Bird Grinnell, was long
one of the most active members of this committee; through this
society, with chapters throughout the country, the cause of bird protection
was for several years immensely aided. Of late it has become
practically the advisory committee of the existing Audubon
Societies which have recently multiplied so gratifyingly throughout the
country, and it publishes in 'The Auk' an annual report summarizing
the work of bird protection for the year.</p>

<p>In extending a helping hand to casual and isolated observers, the
Union has had a marked influence upon the recent progress of ornithology
in America, as shown by the increase in the number of observers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">-&#8239;147&#8239;-</a></span>
who have become contributors to 'The Auk,' and the constantly increasing
number who have allied themselves to the Union by membership
therein. The constitution of the Union provides for four classes of
members; namely, (1) Active Members, limited to fifty, and to include
only those who have distinguished themselves as original investigators
in ornithology, and who reside in the United States or Canada; (2)
Honorary Members, limited to twenty-five, and consisting of the most
eminent of foreign ornithologists; (3) Corresponding Members, limited
to one hundred, and consisting mainly also of eminent foreign ornithologists;
(4) Associate Members, unrestricted as to number, but
limited to residence in the United States or Canada. This class includes
not only a large number of experienced field workers, but many
college professors, educators, and persons eminent in other scientific
fields, but who are not expert ornithologists. It is open to all
reputable persons whose interest in ornithology is sufficient to prompt
them to seek such a congenial alliance.</p>

<p>At the first congress forty-seven ornithologists were elected to
active membership&mdash;presumably all of the satisfactory candidates
available. Of these forty-seven original members, twenty-four were
either present or took a prominent part in the organization of the
Union, and are thus termed 'Founders.' (The accompanying photograph
is a picture of these founders, made up from separate photographs,
it being impracticable for the members to assemble to be
photographed as a group.) This has remained about the average number,
but, as years have passed, the choice for the few coveted places has
become harder and harder each year to fill, through the rapid increase
of not only available but desirable candidates; so that attainments that
would in the earlier days of the Union have proved ample credentials
for admission have now less weight, in the effort to select the best from
a large otherwise desirable candidacy. The honor of the position
has thus become enhanced through competition of merit. The two
foreign classes have remained practically unchanged as regards
numbers. But the class of Associate Members has increased from
about one hundred in 1886 to nearly six hundred in 1898.</p>

<p>The revenue of the Union is derived entirely from the annual
dues from members ($5 for active members and $3 for associate
members) and subscriptions to 'The Auk.' As the ordinary running
expenses of the Union are but a trifle, all of the proceeds from these
sources of revenue are devoted to the publications of the Union.
These include, besides 'The Auk,' now in its sixteenth volume, the
original Code and Check-List of North American Birds (1886), an
Abridged Check-List (1889), a separate reprint of the Code alone
(1892), the second edition of the Check-List (1895), and nine Supplements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">-&#8239;148&#8239;-</a></span>
to the Check-List (1889-1899), varying in size from about 8 to
36 pages.</p>

<p>'The Auk,' issued quarterly, consists on the average of about 420 pages
per year, with at least four fine colored plates, and a greater or less
number of text figures, including of late numerous half-tone illustrations
of birds in life. As practically all of the funds of the Union are
devoted to its publications, and mainly to 'The Auk,' its prosperity
as regards its size, the frequency and character of its illustrations,
and its influence in promoting the study of ornithology, is limited
only by the proceeds from memberships and subscriptions. As it
aims to meet the interests and the necessities of both the scientific
and the non-scientific reader and contributor, the general articles,
comprising more than half of each number, are about equally divided
between popular and technical papers, while its department of General
Notes (embracing some 15 pages in each number), is about
equally acceptable to both classes, as with more or less technical
matter for the benefit of the expert are blended notes on the habits
and distribution of the lesser known species of our fauna, often of a
highly popular character. The department of Recent Literature
gives more or less extended notices of the current literature of
ornithology, including general works, popular and technical, and of
all the principal writings relating to American birds, whether faunal,
economic, popular, or technical.</p>

<p>The meetings of the Union occur in November of each year, and
heretofore have been held alternately in New York, Washington, and
Cambridge or Boston. The present year the meeting, which will be
the seventeenth congress of the Union, will be held in Philadelphia,
Nov. 13-17, 1899. As usual, the public sessions, beginning on the
14th, will be open to the general public, to which all who are
interested in birds are cordially invited.</p>

<p class="caption2">The Prairie Horned Lark</p>

<p class="caption3">BY ROBERT W. HEGNER</p>

<p class="caption4">With photographs from nature by the author</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">A</span>t intervals throughout the winter, but more often after the
first of February, flocks of hardy little brown birds may
be seen about Decorah, Ia., wandering from place to place
in search of food. They are the Prairie Horned Larks,
harbingers of approaching spring. Some weeks later, when
the snow has melted, they seek their favorite haunts in
the pasture lands, select a slight elevation from the surrounding
surface, and proceed to build their nests. They
first dig a hole three inches wide and three inches deep
in the softened ground, and then line it on the bottom and sides
to the depth of an inch with dry grasses, making a warm nest, level
with the surface. I accidentally discovered the first one this season
on April 9. It was nicely lined with vegetable down in addition to
the usual lining of dry grasses, and was finished ready for the eggs.
I returned in a week, but, as the mother bird was not at home, had
to content myself with a photograph of the three finely spotted eggs
which it then contained. Some children who observed my movements
may be held responsible for the destruction of the nest, as
two days later I could find nothing but the hole from which it had
been torn. After a short search another Lark flushed from a nest
of three eggs almost identical with the first and about 300 yards
from it. Unless incubation is far advanced they seldom flush from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">-&#8239;153&#8239;-</a></span>
directly under foot, nor do they run along the ground first, after the
manner of a great many of the ground builders, but keep a good
look out, and fly straight from the nest when anyone comes within
fifty feet of them. It is needless to say that it takes sharp eyes
to discover their exact position.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">HORNED LARK AT NEST</span>
</div>

<p>At my arrival on the bright, sunny morning of April 24, the
Lark was at home, and I had another opportunity of trying to
photograph her. I focused the camera three feet from the nest and
retired to the end of my 60-foot rubber tube. The gophers seemed
to be less afraid of me than the Lark, and several of them played
together some ten feet away. One little striped rascal began gnawing
at the rubber tube, and I was forced to frighten him away.
This tube greatly puzzled the Lark, for in running around the
camera she always came to a halt upon reaching it, and it was
only after repeated trials and much excitement that she screwed up
courage enough to hop over. Twenty minutes seemed to be sufficient
time to reassure her, and with head lowered she hastened to
the nest, looked in, and settled down upon the eggs. An exposure
of one twenty-fifth of a second with stop 16 shows her as she was
looking into the nest. While I reset my shutter and put in a new
plate the Lark left the nest, but this time it took her only two
minutes to return. A photograph of a young bird was taken on
May 7. The pair of birds that were feeding this young one had already
built a second nest, thinner and more loosely put together than the
first, and were incubating four eggs.</p>

<p>The enemies of the Prairie Horned Lark seem to be very numerous.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">-&#8239;154&#8239;-</a></span>
The nest and four eggs mentioned above were plowed under
to facilitate corn planting, while innumerable nests are destroyed
earlier in the season, when the farmers 'break sod.' The first nests
in March and April are often subject to great changes of temperature.
Although they may be built in warm, sunny weather, a sudden cold
wave often covers them with snow and imbeds them in ice.</p>

<p>While waiting for the Lark to become accustomed to the camera,
I had an excellent opportunity of observing its song flight.
Lying there on my back, I enjoyed a splendid exhibition of one of
this bird's peculiar traits. From a point a hundred yards from
where I lay a happy songster suddenly arose, flying upward at an
angle of 45 degrees, not continuously, but in short stretches. When
at a great elevation he began to sing, taking short, quick wing
strokes, and singing while he sailed. In this way a circle 300 yards
in diameter was crossed and recrossed until fully five minutes had
passed, when, suddenly closing his wings, he shot downward like
a bullet, slowly catching himself on nearing the ground and curving
outward to his starting point. Several similar exhibitions were
carried on in exactly the same manner, the time not varying by half
a minute. Though the song lacks many of the fine qualities of
other birds, it clearly expresses the joy and happiness of the
singer. With thrills of pleasure we hear it echo over the hills, and
bless the little creature, hoping that in the 'struggle for existence'
he may thrive and wax exceeding strong.</p>

</div>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">IN </span>the Nature Study course of the Summer School, a little time
was devoted to the honey bee, life of the hive, care and
management, and especially the work of bees in cross-pollination
of flowers and fruits. The closing "laboratory
exercise" in the subject consisted in a honey spread, the
honey being removed from the glass hive in the window
of the laboratory, in the presence of the class, and distributed
with hot biscuits and butter, cream and fresh milk. The
spread was pronounced the most enjoyable "laboratory work" ever
done by members of the class, but to crown the event in the most
exquisite way possible, a Hummingbird flew into an open window,
and darting, unafraid, in and out among the noisy groups of fifty
or more busy people, it rifled the various flowers with which the
laboratory was decorated. In closing the windows for the night it
was accidentally imprisoned, and on visiting the room next morning
(Sunday), I found it still humming about the flowers. Thinking
that it might be a female, with nestlings awaiting its return, I gently
placed an insect net over it with the intention of passing it out of
the window. It proved, however, on closer inspection, to be a young
male, so I thought it could do no harm to keep it a day or two
for acquaintance sake. No sooner was my finger, with a drop of
honey on it, brought within reach, than it thrust its bill and long
tongue out through the net and licked up the honey with evident
delight. Releasing it from the net, I dropped honey into a number
of the flowers, sprinkling water over them at the same time, and it
immediately began feasting and drinking. As it flew about it
taught me its bright little chirp, evidently a note of delight and
satisfaction. When I visited the laboratory again at noon, I took
in my hand a few heads of red clover and a nasturtium with its
horn filled with honey. On giving the chirp a few times, it flew
straight to the flowers in my hand, probed each clover tube, drank
its fill from the nasturtium, and, perching contentedly on my finger,
wiped its bill, preened its feathers, spread out its tail, scratched its
head, and for the space of a minute or two looked me over and
made himself the most delightful of tiny friends. The next time I
entered the room, about two hours later, he flew to the door to
meet me, and this time I took him home, the better to care for
him during the afternoon and evening. In the course of the afternoon
about a dozen friends called. Each one was provided with a nasturtium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">-&#8239;156&#8239;-</a></span>
into which a drop of honey had been placed, and nearly the
whole time the little bird was flying from one to the other, perching
on fingers or sipping from the flowers held in the hand or buttonhole,
to the delight of everybody, none of the company having ever
seen a live Hummingbird so close by.</p>

<p>In the evening he went to roost high up on a chandelier, and in
trying to catch him with the net to put him in a safe cage for the
night, he fell like a dead bird to the carpet. I held him warm in
my hand, thinking that he was about to breathe his last, but anxious
to save the precious little life if possible, I very gently opened the
bill and inserted a pellet of crushed spiders' eggs as large as
a good-sized sweet pea, following it with a drop of water. He had
been feigning, probably, as they are known to do; at any rate, in a
minute he was as bright and lively as ever. His room for the
night was a large insect cage of wire screen filled with convenient
twigs and a large bowl of flowers. At five in the morning I fed
him honey and young spiders, and again at six. At eight I had a
lecture, the subject of which happened to be the taming of wild birds
and attracting them about our homes. Removing all flowers from his
cage to let his appetite sharpen for the two intervening hours, I
set the cage on a table by my side on the lecture platform. I had
taken pains to have two fresh nasturtiums in my buttonhole, one
well loaded with honey, the other filled with the juices of crushed
spiders and spiders' eggs. On reaching the topic of approaching
birds in the right way, appealing to them along the lines of their
tastes and appetites, appealing to the "right end" of a bird, I had
only to open the door, give the familiar chirp, and the little charmer
was probing the flowers. Then, as if anxious to show off, he again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">-&#8239;157&#8239;-</a></span>
perched on my hand and went through his <i>post prandial</i> toilet, thus
giving the class an idea of bird-taming which no amount of books
or anything I might have said could have possibly equaled. Many
expressed themselves as never having seen so successful a "demonstration."
Some said that I must be in league with higher powers,
and it all must have been "providential." This may be true, for
anything I know to the contrary. But it may have been simply improving
the opportunities of a happy accident; and 'accidents,'
we know, "never happen among the Hottentots." If flowers and
honey can do it, at any rate, such accidents shall be more frequent
about my home in the future.</p>

<p class="caption2">A Peculiarity of a Caged Skylark</p>

<p class="caption2">BY H. M. COLLINS</p>


<div class="fig_left" style="width: 127px;">

</div>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">D</span>o birds reverse the usual order of things, and from
a serious and stolid youth develop mature playfulness?
I have been led to ask myself this
question by observing the extraordinary playfulness
exhibited by a pet Skylark in extreme old age. Upon hearing
the owner of the bird declare, "Dickie has reached his dotage, and,
is now in a state of second childhood," it occurred to me that birds
have no season of youthful frivolity such as Mother Nature accords
to her other children. We are accustomed to associate the idea of
youth with playfulness: we picture to ourselves the lamb frisking
in the meadows, the frolicsome kitten playing upon the hearth, and
we groan inwardly when we meditate upon the destructive propensities
of our pet puppies, but we think of our young feathered friends as
lying inert in their nests, gaping wide open their yellow-edged beaks
incessantly for food, and apparently interested in nothing else.</p>

<p>A caged Skylark is a deplorable object generally, but the Lark
of which I am about to write was a bird 'with a history,' and one,
whose cage was not a prison but a home. While his native meadow
(in Ireland) was being mowed, one of his wings was struck by the
mowing-machine and the last joint terribly mutilated. One of the
workmen picked up the poor little sufferer and gave him to a little
boy whose father was something of a naturalist and a great lover of
birds. Examination of the shattered wing revealed the fact that
amputation of the last joint would be necessary if the bird's life was
to be preserved. The operation was performed, and the little patient
was placed in a very large cage carpeted with fresh, green sods.
He was well supplied with food and water; the injured wing healed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">-&#8239;158&#8239;-</a></span>
rapidly; he became surprisingly tame, and soon appeared to enjoy
life thoroughly. Occasionally, he was permitted to enjoy his freedom
in a large room, but after running about awhile, always seemed glad
to return to his cage, the door of which was left open, so that he
might go home when he pleased.</p>

<p>He was a beautiful singer, and used to stand in the long grasses
and fresh clover of his sod, quiver the poor pinions that could never
again soar skyward, and burst into the glorious carol with which
he had been wont to salute the sunrise, when, high up among the
fleecy clouds, he had appeared an almost invisible speck of personified
melody to the enchanted listeners below.</p>

<p>As the years sped by, this much-indulged bird craved petting
and attention to an abnormal degree, could be coaxed at any hour
into singing, and formed the strange habit of trilling a low, sweet
carol at ten o'clock every night, which his mistress called his "good-night
song." When he had been caged for twelve or thirteen years
he become as playful as a kitten, and was particularly fond of going
through what his mistress called the "jungle tiger act," which consisted
of crouching down out of sight in the grasses of his sod, and
then springing suddenly forward to bite in a gentle way a finger
poked between the wires of his cage. He never wearied of this game
so long as he could induce a child or grown person to engage in it
with him, and before he died, a year or so later, he developed a
degree of playfulness that almost amounted to imbecility.</p>

'On the Ethics of Caging Birds.'</p>

<p class="smaller">[As stated in our last issue, Mrs. Miller's paper on '<a href="#On_the_Ethics_of_Caging_Birds">The Ethics of Caging Birds</a>,'
in <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> for June, brought us numerous letters, from which we have selected two,
representing both sides of the question, for publication. As a further contribution
to this discussion we publish in this number of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> several papers describing
experiences with caged birds.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>


<p class="caption4"><span class="smcap">To the Editor of Bird-Lore.</span></p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>:&mdash;I have always been such an admirer of Mrs. Miller's
writings that I confess to a feeling of great disappointment in her
article concerning caged birds, which appeared in your June number
of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>. Will you allow me to comment on it briefly?</p>

<p>Mrs. Miller starts out with the position that while she disapproves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">-&#8239;159&#8239;-</a></span>
with "all her heart" of caging wild birds, yet since "birds are caged
we must deal with circumstances as we find them."</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Mrs. Miller is right in sounding a note of warning
for those who keep birds as pets, by impressing upon them the care
that should be given these utterly helpless little creatures. She
says, "Not one bird in a thousand is properly cared for," and she
might add to that the fact that thousands die every year of hunger,
thirst, lack of care,&mdash;forlorn prisoners, utterly unable to help themselves.
These facts being true, the inconsistency of her position is
that she gives the slightest encouragement to the bird traffic which
results in so much cruel suffering. She says that the discomfort they
suffer in the bird stores is so great that she feels it to be "a work
of charity to purchase them," yet she does not seem to see that every
purchaser is in a measure accountable for this suffering. If no one
would buy the birds, the traffic would soon cease.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Miller appears to be utterly hopeless as to the cure of
this evil, for she says: "If a bird-lover should worry and fret
himself to death he could not put an end to their captivity." It is
exceedingly fortunate that there have been, and still are, and probably
always will be, a few men and women in the world who believe
with Emerson that "Nothing is impossible to the man who can will,"
and who, in spite of the perplexing outlook, go forward, and bring
about the world's great reforms.</p>

<p>The first step in repressing any wrong is for some individual to take
a firm stand, even in the face of the greatest discouragement. Another
will follow, and then another, and by and by, when we have
hardly begun to believe anything has been done, a wave sweeps
over the country, and the wrong is righted. This, however, can
never be brought about unless by individual action and the abiding
faith that every one counts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Miller advances as her "strong argument" the great value
of caged birds as pets in the education of the child, and upsets her
own argument by saying: "Nothing is more important than the
training of our youth in humanity, and respect for the rights of
others." "Respect for the rights of others" means justice to all the
dumb or helpless creation. Even a child can reason out for himself
that a bird was created for freedom in the upper air, not for confinement
in a cage, and that, even if it is bred in a cage, it is no
more just or right to put it to such purposes than it would be to
keep a dog chained all day, or a horse tied in a stable all his life,
or a man confined within the narrow limits of prison walls.</p>

<p>Children have ample opportunity to be taught kindness, and, what
is even better than kindness, justice to the animal creation by having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">-&#8239;160&#8239;-</a></span>
the care of cats or dogs, yet how few mothers or teachers take pains
to teach the right care of these common animals, which are to be
found everywhere, and are dependent on man for their happiness.
A child will not discriminate between the bird bred in a cage and
the bird taken from the mother's nest for the purpose of being
brought up in a cage, and while birds are given as pets to children,
not only the traffic in canaries is encouraged, but the snaring, or the
capturing by other means, of our own song birds will continue. It seems
to me there is but one lesson to teach children in relation to birds,&mdash;that
they were made to be free, and to have space to use the wings
that surely cannot have proper exercise even in the confined space
of a house.</p>

<p>Let those who already have birds take good care of them, by all
means; give them the right food and plenty of fresh water, and as
much freedom as possible in the limits of the house; but let those
who are true bird-lovers discourage the traffic in birds in every way
possible, no matter how hopeless it may seem just now to endeavor
to put a stop to it, for the influence of every individual counts.</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>:&mdash;In the main Mrs. Miller's statement of the case is the
one that I have come to adopt. In fact, my prejudices against the
practice of caging birds were entirely banished and the whole subject
revealed in a new light by reading Mrs. Miller's 'Bird Ways.'
Such wonderful possibilities of bird happiness, child culture and education,
and bird study were opened up by this little book that, from
being opposed to caged birds, I was converted to believe that the
cage might be made one of the most important factors in the great
new field of bird study, and, I hope, actual bird culture, which seems
to be dawning before us.</p>

<p>The subject has a number of ethical bearings which Mrs. Miller
does not touch upon, two of which I may point out.</p>

<p>First: We may not only have a "right" to confine a bird, but
it may become a duty which we owe not only to the bird itself, but to
the community as well. The moment before beginning to write this
a young Robin was sitting warmly in my hand gulping down earthworms
and blackberries. He is now sleeping quietly in a cage by
my side. I picked him up this noon on the ground under the nest,
unable to fly, and I love to think of him safe and cosy instead of
fluttering in the jaws of some miscreant cat. Some days ago a boy
came and told me that a neighbor's wife had taken a young Robin
away from her cat "and put it on top of the shed" (to fall down
into the cat's mouth again). At my request he brought the bird, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">-&#8239;161&#8239;-</a></span>
it was so lacerated that it died that night. Of two nests of Robins
I have known this season, in spite of me, the cats got seven of the
young, and the eighth would have gone the same way were it not
sleeping safely in another of my cages. In all, I have three young
Robins, all picked up from the ground, unable to fly, all, without the
shadow of a doubt, saved from the cats. None have died in my hands,
the one killed by the neighbor's cat not counted, and they seem to be
fairly happy little birds, though it is to be hoped that they will grow
happier as they grow wiser. My point is simply that in the present
exigency of our rapidly decreasing bird life, every child should learn
how to care for fledglings of different species and have suitable cages
where they may be kept until, at least, they are able to fly. This
may often be done by hanging
the cage near the nest,
where the parents will feed it.
Our children owe this work
to the community, to themselves
and to the birds. I am
aware some will say that this
will lead to the death of more
fledglings than now go to feed
the cats. And under present
conditions, I regret to say,
there is a good deal of truth
in it. In trying to get children
interested in this work,
I have been surprised to find
so many who say, "Oh yes,
I would like to have some
tame Robins so much; but you
can't keep them alive. I have
tried it, and they all died."
"What did you feed them?"
"Oh, bread crumbs;" now
and then one will say "worms
and berries." "Did they eat?"
"No, I never saw them eat
anything." "Did you give them
any water to drink?" "No, I
didn't think of that." "How
often do you feed them? Do
you know that birds are flying appetites? Did you feed them regularly
about every hour?" "No, I put in some stuff generally about once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">-&#8239;162&#8239;-</a></span>
a day." And so it goes. But shall we be content with this state of
things when any bright child can be given the necessary instruction
in an hour by which he can succeed in keeping alive and taming
practically all the fledglings that fall in his way?</p>

<p>Second: We owe it as a duty to both the birds and ourselves
to learn the facts of bird life. We do not adequately know the
life story of a single one of our most common species. Every fact
that can be discovered as to the good or the harm that birds do
<i>ought</i> to be found out. Every fact so discovered will act as just so
much more motive force to bring about proper relations with our
birds. A few birds have been killed, and the stomach contents
analyzed, to obtain facts about bird foods which have changed our
sentiments and even legislation. Somebody owed this as a duty to
both birds and community. But this method is not well adapted for use
in elementary schools, and its results might be infinitely extended and
the subject of bird foods made a matter of practical public education,
by having classes in nature study throughout our schools make
feeding tests with tame birds of different species. Cages will have
to play at least a temporary role in work of this kind. More than
this, a knowledge of bird ways, habits, methods of feeding and
caring for their nests and young, their songs and calls, "their
manners for the heart's delight," are great &aelig;sthetic and educational
values. These might all be developed and enhanced by a proper
use of caged birds. Instead of collections of stuffed birds, the ethics
and educational value of which I wish might be discussed in <span class="smcap">BIRD-LORE</span>,
each city might have, possibly maintained by some ornithological
society, a fine collection of pairs of a few of our most valuable
species. These could make the rounds of the schools each year.
This, too, need only be a temporary expedient, useful until sufficient
general interest and knowledge is developed so that we may have,
properly appreciated and protected, an abundance of our native birds
tamed sufficiently to come close about our homes.</p>

<p>The above are but two points among many, and I bring them
forward to bespeak a little intelligent favor for the proper use of
the cage. We owe the birds duties of protection and acquaintance,
and the cage may help us in the performance of both.</p>

<p class="caption2">Oliver Twist, Catbird</p>

<p class="caption3">BY ISABELLA McC. LEMMON</p>


<div class="fig_left" style="width: 109px;">
<img src="images/pg_49.png" width="109" height="134" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="dropcap">O</div>
<p class="p0">n July 9, 1898, we caught a young Catbird. He
had left the nest the day before, and had then
eluded all our efforts, but by morning a pouring
rain had removed his objections to captivity, and a very
wet, bedraggled little Catbird was established in the big
cage. He soon stopped trying to get out, and seemed
quite contented&mdash;except occasionally when the old birds
heard him calling for food and came to the rescue. But
that was carefully guarded against, and as his voice lost its baby tone
they left him in peace.</p>

<p>A name was quickly given, the frequency and great size of his
meals promptly gaining for him the title of 'Oliver Twist.' Worms,
currants, goose-, rasp-, black-, and huckleberries, bits of bread
soaked in milk, all went down, but the fruit seemed somewhat more
acceptable. On July 16, the amount of food was greatest: 43 earthworms
and 81 berries between 7 a. m. and 6.50 p. m.</p>

<p>As the different berries ripened he gave up the early kinds and
accepted the new ones most eagerly, elderberries especially. These
last he ate by the bunch&mdash;indeed one need only walk past a patch
of the bushes when the fruit is ripe, to appreciate a Catbird's fondness
for them.</p>

<p>By the 16th Oliver had taken his first bath, and for the first time
I saw him drink. Four days later, when he must have been about
four weeks old, we heard him trying to sing&mdash;queer little chirps and
gurgles in the lowest of tones, but evidently intended for a song.
He stopped as soon as he saw me, raising his wings and begging
for food, and for some time we were obliged to enjoy his musical
efforts by stealth.</p>

<p>By August 1, he was pretty well feathered; the tail was almost
full length, and even the little feathers over the nostrils had started
to grow. He was also able to feed himself then, but greatly preferred
being fed; often, when I offered him more than he wanted,
giving a low 'chuck' very like the old birds' call.</p>

<p>As August progressed worms were refused, and though bread and
milk and all sorts of berries were eaten, the bird evidently missed
something. He was molting a little&mdash;if the loss of so few feathers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">-&#8239;164&#8239;-</a></span>
could be called a molt&mdash;but became more and more droopy, refusing
or indifferently eating the various things we tried, till some one gave
him a fly! Then all went well; he ate all the flies we could catch,
sometimes twenty at a meal, and also wasps and bees. When he saw
somebody bringing one of the latter dainties he would jump about in
great excitement; then, snatching the insect, kill it with a few quick
pinches and swallow it, poison and all. He also learned the motion
made in catching a fly, and was on the alert as soon as he saw me
snatch for one.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the month I let him out of doors&mdash;though
he had often been out in the house&mdash;and after that he had exercise
nearly every day, flying about a little, coming readily to me when
I whistled, and generally returning to the cage quickly enough for a
few flies. He evidently regarded the cage as home, for let any large
bird pass at what he considered too close quarters and in he went
like a flash, there to remain till the danger was past. On one occasion,
when he was hopping among the plants in the house, I saw him
carefully watching a Crow that was fighting his way against a heavy
wind. Suddenly the Crow gave way, making a swoop almost to the
window, and in far less time than it can be told the Catbird was in
the cage and up on a perch, so terrified that it was some minutes
before he was himself again.</p>

<p>About the middle of September Oliver Twist caught the migration
fever, and when no one was in sight was very uneasy in his cage,
not only during the day but at night as well. In the evening the
bird was always moved to a dark back hall, where he usually settled
down at once; now he was most restless, chucking and mewing
sometimes for nearly an hour, and not until late in October did he
finally become quiet. Cool days, also, made him more uneasy.</p>

<p>During the fall months Oliver ate every sort of berry I could find,
from dogwood to Boston ivy, with two exceptions: those of the wild
rose and the catbriar. The seeds of the ivy berries he always ejected,
perfectly clean and free from pulp, beginning about half an hour
after swallowing them; he would work the bill a little, as if the seed
were in his mouth, a moment later pushing it out with the tongue.
At first they appeared quite rapidly&mdash;two or three or even more
in a minute&mdash;then more slowly, and continued for at least three-quarters
of an hour.</p>

<p>As the house flies disappeared, the big blue and green species,
that during the summer were simply scorned, grew quite tempting;
but even these gave out, and it became very difficult to find proper
food for the little fellow. Figs for a time supplied the place of berries,
but he tired of them at last, and bits of meat never passed for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">-&#8239;165&#8239;-</a></span>
flies or for the worms that even in the greenhouse went down beyond
reach of the trowel.</p>

<p>The cage now stood among the plants in a sunny window of the
dining-room, and the conversation at meal times generally started
Oliver singing; yet it was always a low version of the usual Catbird
song, for he invariably sang with the bill nearly closed. Often in the
dark December mornings he was scarcely awake when breakfast began,
but in a few minutes we would hear his cheerful little song&mdash;the first
thing in his day&mdash;before he even left his night's perch. Then, as
the sun touched him there came a great arranging of feathers and
a good shake to put each one in place again, and then breakfast.</p>

<p>The bath was almost never omitted from the time the bird was
about a month old, and often he bathed twice a day if the first were
given him early in the morning; and how he enjoyed it! shuffling up
the water with his wings, ducking his head, and spattering in every
direction till he was soaked through, then going to the perch and
flicking wings and tail and ruffling the feathers until dry.</p>

<p>To some extent Oliver showed affection by coming most readily
to me, who generally fed him, and by an odd little greeting he usually
gave when I offered him my finger, gently pinching it or giving
a slight peck, too mild ever to be mistaken for anger. Unfortunately
this was broken up by the teasing of another member of the family,
and the pecks became too severe to be altogether agreeable.</p>

<p>He was growing more wild and more unwilling to return to his
cage, and I intended to let him go when spring came, but long before
that time he got sickly and sluggish, eager for the berries and insects
that were not to be found, and in spite of everything I tried in their
stead, he died late in December.</p>

<p>But though Oliver Twist lived so short a time he taught me many
interesting lessons, one of which, in particular, I shall long remember:
never try to keep a fruit- and insect-eating bird through the
winter, for no amount of willingness and care can supply him with
proper food. Take nature's word for it&mdash;she knows quite well what
she is about when she sends them all off to the south.</p>

<p class="caption2">Birds and Caterpillars</p>


<p>Last year, at Brandon, Vermont, the
tent-caterpillars were so abundant as to
be a serious injury and annoyance.
They lay in close rows, making wide
bands on the tree trunks. They spun
down from the upper branches and fell
upon the unfortunate passers-by. They
crawled through the grass in such numbers
that it seemed to move in a mass
as one looked down upon it. Under
these circumstances, birds might be expected
to do strange things,&mdash;and they did.</p>

<p>The pair of Downy Woodpeckers which
lived near us were frequently seen on
the ground picking up the crawling tent-caterpillars.
They seemed to prefer taking
them from the ground to taking them
from the trees, though there were more
on the tree-trunks than on the ground
even. And the Woodpeckers seemed to
have no difficulty in moving on the
ground, though they moved more slowly
than when dodging around a tree.</p>

<p>Two mountain-ash trees on the place
were infested by borers, though only
slightly and only near the ground, and
at the foot of one of these trees the
Downy Woodpeckers made many a stand,
while they probed the borer-holes with
their bills.</p>

<p>The Cuckoos came boldly into the village
and fed and fed, flying about quite openly.
The Nuthatches flew to a band of caterpillars
on a tree-trunk, and were so
busy and absorbed in devouring the
crawlers that I could put my hand on
them before they started to fly, and then
they merely flew to another tree close by,
and attacked another mass of caterpillars.</p>

<p>Blackbirds waddled over the grass by
the sides of the streets picking up the
crawlers, and even a Woodcock spent
several hours in the garden and on the
lawn, <i>apparently</i> feasting on tent-caterpillars,
but I could not get near
enough to be sure.</p>

<p>The Vireos&mdash;White-eyed, Red-eyed, and
Warbling&mdash;the Cat-birds, Cedar-birds, and
Rose-breasted Grosbeaks did good service
to the trees and human beings, but the
most evident destruction was done by the
Chipping Sparrows when the moths
emerged late in the summer. The moths
were very abundant after four o'clock in
the afternoon, flying about the trees to
lay their eggs, and then the Chippies became
fly-catchers for the time, and flew
straight, turned, twisted, dodged, and
tumbled 'head over heels and heels over
head' in the air, just as the course of the
hunted moth made necessary. A quick
snap of the beak, and four brownish
wings would float down like snowflakes,
and their numbers on the walks, roads
and grass showed how many thousands of
moths were slain. In spite of the unwonted
exercise the Chippies waxed fat,
but not as aldermanic as the Robins, which,
earlier, gorged themselves on the caterpillars
until, as one observer said, "their
little red fronts actually trailed on the
ground."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Caroline G. Soule</span>, <i>Brookline,
Mass.</i></p>


<p class="caption3">An Odd Nesting Site</p>

<p>I have never seen an account of
a House Wren taking up his abode in
another bird's nest. It seemed, therefore,
at first incredible when, early this summer,
we saw a Wren frequenting a deserted
Baltimore Oriole's nest and apparently
start housekeeping in it. This nest was in
one of the outermost branches of a large
sugar maple about twenty feet from the
ground and the same distance from the
farm-house, and was completely filled with
twigs by its tenants. The little Wren's
choice was the more remarkable, in that a
number of bird houses had been placed
about the grounds for their special accommodation.
I believe none of these were
occupied, and this pair deliberately preferred
the Oriole's nest.&mdash;<span class="smcap">L. H. Schwab</span>,

Mifflin &amp; Co. 1899. 12mo, pp.
viii + 149.</p>

<p>Text-books based on successful experiences
in teaching generally prove to be of
value, and the present volume is no exception
to the rule. It contains what its
author has found to be the most adequate
definition of the bird in her talks on this
little-known creature to boys and girls. It
is well-named a 'First Book of Birds,'
Mrs. Miller's aim being to arouse an intelligent
interest in bird-life before confronting
the inquirer with 'keys' and discouraging
identification puzzles. She,
therefore, begins with the nest, and outlines
the development of the bird, following
this section by chapters on the bird's
language, food, migration, intelligence,
etc., and concluding with sections on 'How
He is Made,' and 'His Relations with Us.'
The matter is well chosen, and so admirably
arranged that no attentive reader can
fail to receive a clear and logical conception
of the chief events in a bird's life.&mdash;F. M. C.</p>


<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Field Key to the Land Birds.</span> By
<span class="smcap">Edward Knobel</span>. Boston, Bradlee
Whidden. 1899. 16mo, pp. 55, numerous
cuts in the text and 10 colored
plates.</p>

<p>This is an attempt to make plain the
way of the field student, to whom every
aid is welcome. One hundred and fifty-five
land birds are divided into four groups,
according to their size, and are arranged
on nine colored plates, in the preparation
of which the publishers have evidently
struggled with the evils of cheap lithography,
or some inexpensive color process.
Experience in this direction makes
us a lenient critic, and our standard has
been reduced from the level of perfection
to that of recognizability; that is, if a
plate is sufficiently good to unmistakably
represent a certain species, even crudely,
we view it solely from a practical standpoint,
and admit that it doubtless serves its
purpose. Applying this test to the plates
under consideration, we are forced to
state that, although fairly familiar with
the species figured, we are in many cases
unable to name the figures.</p>

<p>The text is condensed and to the point,
and the pen and ink illustrations liberally
scattered through it will be found useful
by beginners, to whom the book may be
commended.&mdash;F. M. C.</p>

pp. 34, 3 half-tones, 8 line cuts in text.
10 cts. per copy, $6 per 100 copies.</p>

<p>This is a contribution to the pedagogics
of ornithology which cannot fail to interest
every one desirous of seeing bird studies
introduced in our schools. It opens with
a chapter on the 'Biology of Our Common
Birds,' which shows the importance of
becoming acquainted with them, giving, in
fact, the reasons which have actuated Professor
Hodge in his work in the schools of
Worcester.</p>

<p>The nature of this work and the success
which has attended it are set forth in the
succeeding pages, whose contents are indicated
by the sub-titles 'The Bird
Census,' 'The Food Chart' (A very useful
compilation by Miss Helen A. Ball, showing
graphically the food of our commoner
birds), 'Bird Study in the Schoolroom,'
'Taming Our Wild Birds and
Attracting Them to Our Houses,' and a
'Life Chart of Our Common Birds.'
Lack of space prohibits a description of
the methods of bird-study given under
these headings. Some of the results of
their practical application, however, are
to be found in the concluding chapter on
the 'Ten-to-One Clubs' formed in the
Worcester schools, which were joined by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">-&#8239;168&#8239;-</a></span>
"not less than 5,000 children," who signed
the club constitution, which opens by
stating that "the object of the club shall
be to use every means possible to increase
the number of our native wild birds by
providing them, when necessary, with
food, water, shelter and nesting places."</p>

<p>The pamphlet gives other and equally
striking proofs of the enthusiasm with
which the children welcomed the opportunity
of becoming familiar with birds,
and indeed is the most convincing proof
of the educational value of bird study
which has come to our attention.&mdash;F. M. C.</p>


<p class="caption3">Book News</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> its August issue 'Our Animal
Friends,' the organ of the American Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
concludes its twenty-sixth volume.
This magazine is edited with a breadth of
view which must result in winning many
supporters for the cause it represents. In
its columns we find no senseless tirades
against the inhumanity of partly civilized
man, but sane, logical discussions of the
rights of animals and the manner in which
they may best be secured; of the habits of
animals, including many interesting papers
on birds,&mdash;of animals and their value to
man, all of which are calculated to arouse
sympathy or interest in them and respect
for the journal which so ably champions
their welfare.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Wilson Bulletin</span>,' No. 26, issued May
30, 1899, has an extremely interesting
paper by its editor, Lynds Jones, recording
the number of species observed
by him on May 8, in Lorain county, Ohio.
Work was begun about Oberlin at 3.30
a. m., and continued at 11 a. m. at Lorain
on the shore of Lake Erie, resulting,
finally, in a record of 112 species identified
with the aid of an "Eight Power
Bausch &amp; Lomb" field-glass during one
day. This number speaks volumes for the
observer's activity and the richness of his
field; we doubt if it has ever been exceeded
in the same period of time in North America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C. Barlow</span> publishes in the May-June
issue of the Bulletin of the Cooper
Ornithological Club, of which he is editor-in-chief,
an eloquent appeal to ornithologists
to take only such birds as they may
require for their own use, and not to collect
birds at all during the nesting season.
Particularly does he condemn collecting for
profit, saying with equal force and truth,
"Every naturalist owes it to science to
protect the natural beauties with which
the Creator has blessed the earth, and how
can the collector, with never a twinge of
conscience, quiet the sweet voices of the
woodland in a fashion little less than barbarous,
for pecuniary gain."</p>

<p>We congratulate Mr. Barlow on the
stand he has taken, and we congratulate
all bird-lovers on the fact that his declaration
of principles adds another journal to
the list of those in which the egg-thief cannot
boast of his exploits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle, appreciating the significance
of the widespread and constantly increasing
interest in birds, has decided to introduce
a volume on ornithology into its
course of 'Required Reading,' Miss Merriams'
'Birds Through an Opera-glass,'
one of the first, as it is one of the best
text-books for beginners, having been
selected for this purpose. Implying, as
it does, the formation of a class of several
thousand bird students, this may be considered
a step in educational ornithology
of unusual importance.</p>

on the '<a href="#Hints_to_Young_Bird_Students">Hints to Young Bird Students</a>,'
published in <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> for August, says:
"This paper deserves the most serious consideration
from all. It is well meant, it is
timely, it is sensible; the friendly advice it
tenders should be accepted and observed."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Writer</span> on the slaughter of birds for
millinery purposes, in 'The New Illustrated
Magazine' for September, whose zeal for
the cause of bird protection exceeds his
knowledge of ornithology, makes, among
others, the remarkable statement that
"Florida is now the only country in
which Hummingbirds are found, except
as rarities." He also gives a unique bit
of information in regard to the Toucan,
which is said to use its "big beak" to
trim its "primary tail-feathers"!</p>

<p>At first thought there seemed to be little
connection between the 'closet' ornithologist,
minutely examining his series
of specimens and describing differences
which, to the untrained eye, do not exist,
and the bird-lover in the fields and woods
with heart atune to nature's songsters.
But one has only to read Dr. Allen's
article on the American Ornithologists'
Union in order to appreciate the close
relationship existing between scientific and
popular ornithology. The organization of
the Union brought isolated bird students
throughout the country in touch with the
leaders in ornithology and, perhaps, for
the first time, made them aware that there
were successors to Wilson and Audubon.</p>

<p>This result was due largely to the work
of the Union's Committee on Migration,
which, under the direction of its chairman,
Dr. C. Hart Merriam, sent out
thousands of circulars calling for observers
to supply it with data on migration.
Circumstances have thus far permitted
the publication of only a small
portion of the vast amount of information
secured by this committee, but even if
not another word is set in type, it can be
said to have created a new era in the
history of American ornithology. It
asked for assistance, but it gave far more
than it received. Its chairman and his
superintendents of districts became, as
it were, instructors in ornithology, with
pupils in nearly every state in the Union
and throughout Canada. The value of
the advice they gave to students who had
been plodding in the dark, prompted only
by an innate love of birds, cannot be overestimated,
but we believe it to be a
demonstrable fact that the popularity of
bird-study in this country to-day is due
more to the aid and encouragement given
students by the members of the American
Ornithologists' Union's Committee on
Migration than to any other influence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> connection with the publication of a
plate of '<a href="#QUILLS_TO_AVOID">Quills to Avoid</a>,' we would add
to Mrs. Wright's plea for the Eagle an
appeal for the preservation of the Brown
Pelican. The feathers of this bird are
now worn so commonly&mdash;hundreds may
be seen in New York City daily&mdash;that
every one knowing of the ease with which
the bird may be killed and its comparatively
restricted range, must feel that at the
present rate of destruction its early extinction,
at least in the United States, is assured.</p>

<p>From Texas reports come to us of the
slaughter of Brown Pelicans in large
numbers, and we have also heard rumors
that they are being killed for their feathers
in Florida. If the residents of the last-named
state could be made to realize how
infinitely more valuable to them a live
Pelican is than a dead one, we do not
for a moment doubt that its destroyers
would speedily receive their deserts.</p>

<p>This apparently ungainly, but in reality
singularly graceful bird is the most picturesque
element in the life of Florida's coasts,
where its size and familiarity render it
conspicuous to the least observing. To the
tourist it is as much an object of interest
as the alligators or cabbage palms. It is distinctly
strange and foreign, and its presence
lends a character to the view given by no
other bird in Florida. Its loss would, therefore,
be irreparable, and we appeal to every
lover of Florida to aid in its protection.</p>

<p class="caption3">Consistency.</p>

<p>Audubonites may be divided into two
classes as regards their attitude toward
the wearing of feathers,&mdash;the moderates
and the total abstainers.</p>

<p>The moderates hold that they violate
none of the interests of bird protection
in its fullest sense by wearing the plumes
of game or food birds, or those of the
Ostrich, which is as legitimately raised
for its feathers as a sheep for its wool.
In short, they see the necessity of keeping
feather-wearing within conservative
bounds, and elect to take the individual
responsibility of so doing.</p>

<p>The total abstainers say: "Let us break
ourselves altogether of the feather wearing
habit. We shall be more conspicuously
consistent as bird protectionists, and
we shall not be called upon to settle fine
points and follow difficult boundaries.
We need not know anything about
plumage, and never have to decide
whether the wings used by milliners are
really those of food birds, or the pinions
of song birds disguised with dye. Or
if the fearfully manufactured confections
are the heads of real Owls and Parrots
twisted out of all semblance to nature,
or merely compounds of Chicken feathers
and celluloid." Both of these attitudes
are equally useful to the cause
if they are maintained consistently, but
inevitably the way of the total abstainers
is the easier of the two. The total
abstainers need not, to quote Hamlet,
"know a hawk from a handsaw." While,
in order to be consistent, the moderates
must be bird students of no mean intelligence
if they would keep safely on
the exceedingly narrow pathway that divides
the feathers that may be, from
those that <i>must not</i> be worn, not alone
by Audubonites, but by any woman who
has either sense or sensibility. A pathway?
A slack wire is the better simile,
so treacherous is the footing.</p>

<p>What is it that causes the downfall
of many of the moderates, who know
the common birds fairly well, and could
not be hoodwinked into buying Egret's
plumes or dyed swallow wings?</p>

<span class="fig_caption">QUILLS TO AVOID</span>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Inner wing quill of Bald Eagle; length, 10-13 inches; brownish black, more or less white at the base.</p>

<p>2. Outer wing quill of Bald Eagle; length, 15-24 inches; black, often whitish or brownish at the base,
the broader web of the five outer quills notched, this notch being absent from the remaining quills.</p>

<p>3. Outer wing quill of Brown Pelican; length, 15-17 inches; black, the quill, or midrib, white for about
two-thirds its length.</p>

<p>4. Inner wing quill of Brown Pelican; length, about 10 inches; blackish brown, the outer margins,
particularly of the narrower web, frosted with silver-gray.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">-&#8239;172&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p>You can guess easily, for you have
seen the tempter protruding above and
behind the up-to-date outing hat the entire
season, and unless you are unusually
lucky it has poked you reproachfully
in the eye, as if calling your attention
to its plight.</p>

<p>"The Quill of course!"</p>

<p>Yes, the Quill is the mischief-maker. At
its introduction many years ago, the
Quill was at first the harmless feather of
a Crow, or a Goose quill sedate enough to
make a pen for a judge. After awhile
it took on dabs of color and even
spangles, but all this time it was a good
safe outing and rainy day ornament.</p>

<p>Then a change came, the Quill grew
suddenly longer with a curl to its tip
that made one wonder, if natural, how its
original wearer had lived with it. This
Quill, however, did not stay well in curl,
and less than a year ago it was displaced
by the reigning favorite, a Quill as aggressively
impertinent as any that decks the
cap of the operatic Mephisto, but not
half as becoming to the wearer.</p>

<p>Now comes the inconsistency of the
moderates. They wear these Quills blindly,
because they have not studied birds
thoroughly enough to distinguish between
plumages except when aided by decided
color. The sentence, "It is only a
Quill," covers deadly sins of omission. I
have cornered several women who are
what might be called aggressive Audubonites:
"Do you know that the notched
Quill in your hat is a pinion of the
American Eagle?" "Oh no, you must
be mistaken, it surely is only a Goose,
or perhaps a Turkey feather, and besides,"&mdash;drawing
herself up with superior
wisdom, "Eagles are very rare birds,
that fly so high it is very difficult to
shoot them, and I know at least fifty
people who are wearing these Quills."</p>

<p>Rare? yes, pinion of peerless flight!
But what bird can fly so high or find so
eery a resting place as to escape the
'desire of the eye' of fashion? Pause
a moment, well-meaning sisters of 'little
knowledge.' Hold a Quill class and lay
your outing hats on the dissecting table!
Study out the things you have been
wearing, and you will be wiser, and I
hope sadder also, resolving either to join
the total abstainers, or to devote enough
time to bird study to be consistent in
your actions.</p>

<p>"But," you may say, "We are consistent
even now. The Eagle is neither
a song bird, an insect eater, nor a game
bird, and from an economic standpoint
it can only be considered as a bird of
prey and an eater of wastage."</p>

<p>Yes, this is all true, and yet, in the
higher view of life, the poetic value of
things must take rank with the practical.
And what bird expresses wild grandeur
and poetry of motion in so great a degree
as the Eagle? What has Burroughs recently
said of it?&mdash;"The days on which
I see him are not quite the same as the
other days. I think my thoughts soar a
little higher all the rest of the morning;
I have had a visit from a messenger of
Jove. The lift or range of those great
wings has passed into my thought."</p>

<p>Pegasus harnessed to a plow or 'C&aelig;sar
dead and turned to clay,' stopping a hole
'to keep the wind away,' would not be a
greater misuse than thus plucking the
pinions of our national Bird of Freedom
to act as rudders to women's hats.</p>

<p class="caption3">Audubon's Seal</p>

<p class="caption4">(From a granddaughter of Audubon)</p>


<p>Audubon's seal was made from a pen-and-ink
sketch of the Wild Turkey, being
the portrait of a bird
weighing forty pounds.
The painting from
which the seal was reduced
measured about
thirty-six by twenty-eight
inches. A lady friend in Liverpool
having seen the painting, was talking, with
others, to Audubon about it, and said to
him, "Now you ought to have this Turkey
for your coat-of-arms." Audubon said
that he was too much of an American to
use a crest, or coat-of-arms, but that the
picture could be easily reduced to the
size of a fob seal, then all the fashion for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">-&#8239;173&#8239;-</a></span>
gentlemen's watch chains. Some surprise
was expressed by the company present at
this statement, particularly by the "Lady
Rathbone," as Audubon was want to
call her. No more was said then, but in
due time a tiny pen-and-ink sketch, perfect
in every detail, with the motto,
"America my Country," was sent to
Mme. Rathbone, with Audubon's signature
and compliments. Not long after,
Audubon received, to his amazement, a
beautiful fob seal, cut in topaz, which he
wore on his watch chain as long as he
lived. It is now a valued possession held
by his family. The accompanying cut is
made from a die of this seal, and exactly
reproduces it in size, etc.&mdash;<span class="smcap">D. T. A. Tyler.</span></p>


<p class="caption3">Report of the Audubon Society of the
District of Columbia</p>

<p>For the District of Columbia the Secretary
has a most encouraging report.</p>

<p>On Saturday, March 25, a very successful
exhibit of spring millinery was given
at the Hotel Corcoran, the ladies' parlors
being kindly loaned for the occasion.
About 300 women attended the exhibit
in spite of a pouring rain, lasting the
whole afternoon. Quite a number of
bonnets and hats were sold, and every
person attending left well supplied with
Audubon literature.</p>

<p>In April, a free lecture by Mr. Henry
Olds, entitled "Some Familiar Birds,"
was given at the First Baptist church,
which was also kindly loaned for this
most interesting talk. The lecture was
fully illustrated by colored lantern slides,
and was made doubly entertaining by
Mr. Olds' clever imitations of the notes
of the various birds explained. About
400 persons attended this lecture.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Leasitt explained the
aim and objects of the Audubon Society,
Dr. C. Hart Merriam introducing
the lecturer in the unavoidable absence
of the President of the Society, Surgeon
General George M. Sternberg. Audubon
literature was again distributed, and some
copies of Mrs. L. W. Maynard's valuable
book 'Birds of Washington and Vicinity,'
were sold.</p>

<p>The Audubon Society has started an
Audubon collection of books in the new
Free Library. This collection is designed
primarily to be books of reference, large
and expensive works, more especially for
the use of teachers.</p>

<p>For the work in the public schools, Dr.
T. S. Palmer and Miss Elizabeth V.
Brown have been untiring and most successful.
In the spring of 1898, two
classes were arranged, one for teachers
in the Normal School, in charge of Dr.
Palmer, and one for teachers in the
Second and Fourth grades, in the hands
of Mr. H. C. Oberholser. The classes
were limited to 12 members each, and work
extended over ten weeks in 1898-9. Specimens
were kindly loaned by the Biological
Survey, and the classes were enabled to
handle, compare, and identify skins of
175 species of the 290 birds recorded for
the vicinity of Washington. These specimens
included nearly all the land birds
from this vicinity. Hints were given
concerning the classification of birds, the
characters of the principal groups, and
the use of keys.</p>

<p>Short talks were also given on especially
interesting topics, such as the 'Relation of
Birds to other Vertebrates,' 'Feathers and
Feather Structure,' 'Flight,' 'Migration,'
'Food,' and 'Nesting Habits.'</p>

<p>The Society this spring purchased 1,000
Audubon buttons from the Society of the
State of Wisconsin, Miss Elizabeth V.
Brown taking charge of their sale. A
large number were sold to children in
and outside the schools, and while not
strictly members of the Society, they
became more interested in the birds
through the wearing of this attractive
button.</p>

<p>Miss Florence A. Merriam has given
several valuable talks this past spring,
notably one at the Washington Club,
before an audience of about 200 women,
which created great enthusiasm and
brought the Society an increase in membership.
The Secretary has been untiringly
busy in trying to get societies organized
in the South and in some western states.</p>

<p>The central idea of these books is to <i>hold the child's interest</i> by giving him
reading matter (profusely illustrated) that he <i>can understand and enjoy</i>. The lessons,
therefore, relate exclusively to <i>child life</i>.</p>

<p>The First and Second Readers have <i>easier reading-matter</i> and <i>more of it</i> than
do most of the other readers now available for first and second year. They have been
graded with the utmost care.</p>

<p>These books, beginning with the Second Reader, have been planned as an <i>introduction
to literature</i>. The subject-matter, therefore, is confined to material of <i>recognized
literary value</i>.</p>

<p>The aim of the publishers has been to produce <i>an artistic set of Readers</i> that
shall be mechanically as nearly perfect as possible.</p>

<p>As a unique feature in binding, they would call attention to the <i>covers, which are
water-proof</i>, and can be cleansed, when soiled by constant handling, without injury to
the book.</p>

<p>In the Delaware river, just where
it begins to widen out into the
bay, and midway between the
shores of Delaware and New Jersey,
lie two long, low islands, known as
'The Pea-patch' and 'Reedy Island.'</p>

<p>Early in the century the former
of these was selected by the government
as the site of Fort Delaware,
and its importance advanced
proportionately in the popular mind.
Later on, the lower island, which
already boasted of a light-house, became
further dignified by the establishment
of a quarantine station on
its banks.</p>

<p>Although of little importance before
the government claimed them,
these islands were by no means uninhabited,
but were, in fact, well-known
as a winter resort. The
early inhabitants, though much less
imposing than the soldiers and health officers who have superseded
them, did not fail to attract attention&mdash;even newspaper
notoriety; not from their individualities, but from their countless
numbers. In fact they were nothing more than ordinary, despised
black Crows, but Crows in such countless numbers that they could
not fail to be noticed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">-&#8239;178&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p>Every evening they came at dusk by thousands and tens of
thousands, winging their way in long lines from all points of the
compass, and settling down on the reed-covered islands in a solid
black phalanx. This winter roosting habit of the Crows is well-known,
and many roosts have been located, but the habit seems
still to lack a satisfactory explanation. Why should these birds fly
back and forth every day over miles and miles of country to roost
in some definite spot which, so far as we can judge, is no better
suited for roosting purposes than hundreds of other places which
they pass by? And why should they gather together every night in
such numbers as to attract general attention and invite slaughter by
thoughtless gunners, when, by roosting in small numbers wherever
they happen to be feeding, they would escape notice? These are
questions I shall not attempt to solve.</p>

<p>Estimates placed the number of Crows in these two island roosts
at half a million, and they held possession of the islands undisturbed
until about the time of the establishment of Fort Delaware.
They did not relish this intrusion, and determined to desert the
ancestral Pea-patch roost; being also influenced, no doubt, by a storm
which flooded the island at night and drowned thousands of the
unfortunate birds.</p>

<p>The Reedy Island roost continued in use until the establishment
of the Quarantine Station, at a much later day; then it, too, was deserted,
and the famous island roosts were no more.</p>

<p>I have long been interested in the winter gatherings of the
Crows, and made inquiry of the light-keeper at Reedy Island to ascertain
whether any Crows at all remained there at the present time.
I was informed that they came across from Delaware as of old in
long flights from the west, northwest and southwest, but all passed
over the island into New Jersey, where he judged they had established
new winter quarters.</p>

<p>The location of this new roost at once became a matter of interest.
By further inquiry I learned that Crows at Salem, N. J.,
nearly opposite the Pea-patch, flew southwards at evening, and by
plotting this flight line with those given by the light-house keeper,
on a map, I found that they joined some four or five miles below
Salem, and here I felt sure the roost was to be found.</p>

<p>I had little trouble in impressing an ornithological friend, who
resided at Salem, with the importance of locating this roost, and
one cold afternoon in January found us driving off in the direction
taken by the Salem Crow flight.</p>

<p>When we neared the point at which we thought the roost ought
to be, we noticed a scattered line of Crows coming up from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">-&#8239;179&#8239;-</a></span>
south, evidently from feeding grounds on the shores of the bay.
They came along in twos and threes, and alighted in a corn-field
on our left, from which the farmer had neglected to haul in all of
the ears. Here was a rare feast, and about a thousand birds were
already assembled, to whose numbers constant additions were being
made. This, we thought, must be the beginning of the evening
assemblage, but, strange to say, no Crows were coming in from the
west; these were all southern Crows, and, furthermore, they showed
no signs of settling for the night, but were simply intent on the grain.</p>

<p>Driving further on, we inquired of a man where the Crows
roosted, and were assured that they made use of a long strip of
woods lying between us and the river. Investigation, however,
showed not a Crow in the wood, and we were inclined to believe
that we had been purposely misled. Passing through the trees, we
had an unobstructed view of the river. The sun was just setting, a
round, red ball of fire in the west, and in the yellow light we could
see the lines of Delaware Crows crossing towards us, while in the
fields before us were hundreds of Crows lazily flapping about much
as the others were in the corn-field to the east.</p>

<p>Here, again, we were directed back to the same wood and assured
that the birds would repair there when ready. It was just
dusk as we hitched our horse and entered the woods; there was
still no sign of Crows, but as we emerged on the farther side we
found that an immense flight was just beginning to pass overhead
from the westward; evidently the river Crows had concluded that
bedtime had come. They did not, however, alight in the trees, but
passed over and dropped noiselessly into the low fields just before
us, seeming to select a black, burnt area on the far side. To our
amazement this "burnt" patch proved to be a solid mass of Crows
sitting close together, and in the gathering gloom it was difficult to
see how far it extended. Four immense flights of the birds were
now pouring into the fields, in one of which we estimated that 500
Crows passed overhead per minute, during the height of the flight.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark, and we began to think that the birds
had no intention of retiring to the woods, so determined to vary
the monotony of the scene and at the same time warm our chilled
bodies. We, therefore, ran rapidly toward the nearest birds and
shouted together just as they first took wing. The effect was marvellous;
with a roar of wings the whole surface of the ground
seemed to rise. The birds hovered about a minute, and then entered
the woods; we soon saw that but a small portion of the assemblage
had taken wing. Those farther off had not seen us in
the darkness, and doubtless thought that this was merely the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">-&#8239;180&#8239;-</a></span>
of the regular nightly retirement into the trees. The movement,
once started, became contagious, and the Crows arose steadily
section by section. The bare branches of the trees which stood out
clearly against the western sky but a minute before seemed to be
clothed in thick foliage as the multitude of birds settled down.</p>

<p>After all had apparently entered the roost, we shouted again and
the roar of wings was simply deafening; another shout brought the
same result in undiminished force, and even then, probably not half
the birds took wing.</p>

<p>They soon settled down again, and we were glad to leave them
in peace. So far as we could learn they are but little molested,
and let us hope that this may continue. Many of the large roosts
farther north in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, seem to be rapidly
decreasing in size, owing to thoughtless persecution, and eventually
the poor birds may be driven to roost in scattered detachments, as
would, indeed, seem best for their preservation; but if this comes
to pass, one of the most impressive phenomena of our bird-life will
have disappeared.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">J</span>anuary 1, 1898. Northern birds have, as a rule, been
decidedly rare this winter. In November, Goshawks were
quite abundant, and a few Snowy Owls were also to be
seen at that time. As I was returning from a tramp just
at dusk one evening, one of the great white fellows came
sailing by only a few yards from the ground. His manner
of sailing and something in the set of his wings reminded
me strongly of an Eagle flying before the wind; there were
evident the same power and swiftness without visible effort. He
came from the northeast on the wind of a rising storm, and had evidently
but just arrived, being in much more perfect plumage than is
usual in November, appearing, at the distance of only a few yards,
absolutely white, with his big yellow eyes burning among his
snowy feathers.</p>

<p>Snow Buntings were also common in November, and Horned
Larks during the first part of the month. I noticed a large flock
of the latter one morning feeding in the stubble and, observing that
they were moving towards me, crouched motionless until they came
up and surrounded me, gathering seeds in the earnest, industrious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">-&#8239;181&#8239;-</a></span>
manner of domestic Pigeons, and exhibiting but little more alarm
at my presence. On the 27th a Shrike alighted in the top of
the elm near the house, and, after reconnoitering for a few moments,
started down into the orchard, but apparently missed whatever
it struck at and, turning upward, alighted in a smaller elm by the
road, when it at once began tearing to pieces an old bird's nest, behaving
exactly as if in anger at its disappointment.</p>

<p>For some time I was unable to discover what it had at first been
after, but finally caught sight of a Downy Woodpecker clinging motionless
to the underside of a small branch in an apple tree, with
every feather drawn down close to its body, just as an owl does
when trying to escape notice.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 327px;">
<img src="images/pg_181.png" width="327" height="224" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">SNOWY OWL</span>
</div>

<p>After a while it began turning its head from side to side, as if
to make sure its enemy had disappeared. When I attempted to
make it fly, it merely crept mouse-like about the branches until perfectly
certain that the Shrike had gone, when it took wing and flew
to another tree, where it presently went to work as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>Throughout December the only birds to be found were Crows,
Blue Jays, Downy Woodpeckers, Black-capped Chickadees, Nuthatches,
Golden-crowned Kinglets, Brown Creepers, and Partridges,
with an occasional Bald Eagle or Rough-legged Hawk and a very
few Flickers. A large flock of Wild Geese passed over on the 7th,
and I saw a few Tree Sparrows and a Winter Wren about the last
of the month. The Sparrows lingered about until the first week in
January, when a large flock of Snow Buntings made their appearance.
A few days later, however, neither Sparrows nor Buntings
were to be found anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">-&#8239;182&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">January 6.</span> Going through the woods I heard the small birds
making quite a fuss in the young growth, and on looking for the
cause, discovered a Saw-whet Owl in a little hemlock. When I
first caught sight of him he was sitting on one of the smaller
branches ten feet from the ground, apparently asleep, with his back
to the trunk and his head tipped back. On being closely approached,
he seemed to awake suddenly with a start, at once turning
his great round eyes in my direction, and after that, never removed
them from me for an instant, though I walked around his
tree several times. He had a partly eaten white-footed mouse slung
across the branch beside him, probably the remains of his breakfast.</p>

<p>Most of the small birds contented themselves with chirping at
him from the surrounding trees, occasionally approaching to inspect
him more closely and then flying off again, but one Red-breasted
Nuthatch remained from the first on a twig close to the Owl's head,
and kept up a continual harsh rasping cry, as if having some especial
cause of complaint against him. A Flicker and some Blue Jays
alighted in the neighboring trees, but not seeing anything of importance,
soon flew away again.</p>

<p>When I shook the tree the Owl merely fluttered a few yards,
and lit on a maple sapling just out of my reach. The next time
he tried to hide by alighting on the further side of the stem of a
pine several inches in diameter, but finding this of no avail, at
last took a longer flight off
through the woods, where I
was unable to follow him.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">January 28.</span> Heard what
I at first took to be the song
of a Ruby-crowned Kinglet
to-day, but it proved to be a
Black-capped Chickadee, uttering
what was to me an
entirely new note; like the
Kinglet's, only fainter and
shorter, with just a little of
the ring of the Canary's song
in it. He was sitting all
alone under the dark evergreens,
singing to himself in
a manner wholly out of keeping with the general disposition and taste
of the Chickadee. When I at last disturbed him, he flew to another
tree and began searching for insects, uttering the familiar note of
his species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">-&#8239;183&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">February 3.</span> There is a little Junco hopping about the path
to-day, in spite of the fact that the mercury has been very near zero
most of the time for the last fortnight, and that the snow is drifted
eight or ten feet deep in places. He appears to spend a considerable
portion of his time in the woodshed, poking about among
the chips, etc., and I fancy sleeps somewhere about the building.</p>

<p>There are also a few Flickers and at least one Meadowlark in
this vicinity, and since the last heavy snowfall they have become
unusually tame and familiar, coming close about the house for
food. Goldfinches and Tree Sparrows are still quite abundant, and
there is a flock of fifty or sixty Pine Grosbeaks, mostly in young
plumage, in the woods about a mile to the west of us, the first I
have seen this winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">February 6.</span> About five o'clock this evening a large Goshawk
in rather dark plumage came flying across the field only a few yards
above the snow. As he neared a tall elm he rose in the air and
alighted near the top of the tree, and after sitting there for a few
moments, turning his head in all directions, he opened his wings
and tumbled from his perch, falling several yards down among the
branches before regaining his balance, when he flew rapidly off
toward the west and disappeared among the pines. Just a week
ago I noticed where a Goshawk, judging from the tracks in the
snow, had killed a rabbit, so that it would seem that they have not
been entirely absent at any time this winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">February 7.</span> Have just seen a Goshawk, apparently in young
plumage, flying west at a height of perhaps sixty or seventy yards
from the ground.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 358px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">-&#8239;184&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">February 13.</span> The Great Horned Owls began hooting nearly
an hour before sunset this evening. It is remarkable how loud
their cry sounds at a distance of half a mile or even a mile. I
am convinced that they can be heard distinctly two miles away, for
I have often heard them in the day time from a direction in which
the nearest woods were at least as far as that. There are always
several pairs dwelling in a certain dark hemlock swamp about a
mile and a half away, and sometimes in the evening, or by moonlight,
they come hunting across the meadows and pastures, hooting
at intervals as they come. When they get within one hundred
yards or so their cry is loud enough to arouse everyone in the
house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">February 18.</span> Followed the track of a Hawk, apparently a
Goshawk, twenty or thirty rods through the birch woods west of the
cove. From the appearance of the tracks the bird must have
walked much after the manner of a Crow, though dragging its
claws more. Occasionally it hopped for a few feet. There was no
sign of its having killed any game near there and having eaten so
much as to be unable to fly at once, as is sometimes the case. At
times it followed in the tracks of rabbits for some distance. I have
often known them to do this, and am inclined to think that they
occasionally hunt rabbits in this manner where the under-brush
is too dense to allow them to fly through it easily. I have sometimes
followed their tracks through the brush until I came upon
the remains of freshly killed rabbits which they had been eating.
On coming out into an opening, I saw a beautiful male Goshawk
in full blue plumage perched on the top of a dead maple in a
swamp. When I tried to approach, he took wing and flew off
toward the north.</p>

</div>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">IN </span>the early part of the winter of 1898-9 Chickadees were
unusually abundant in Central Park, New York City, and
a friend and myself saw them come down and get some
of the nuts we were feeding to White-throated Sparrows.
We were, of course, much interested, and determined to
see if we could tame them. They would take the nuts
to a limb, eat all they wished, and hide the rest in crevices
in trees or bushes, where, I think, they seldom found them again,
for the impudent and ever wide-awake English Sparrow watched
and got the pieces almost as soon as they were deposited. After
feeding them in this way for some time, we tried to get them to eat
from our hands, and finally succeeded by first placing our hands
on the ground with a nut about a foot from our fingers, then a
little nearer, then on the ends of our fingers, and lastly in the
palms of our hands. There was a great shout when they hopped
on our hands the first time, our delight being indescribable.</p>

<p>Finding that kneeling or bending over on the ground was rather
hard work, we tried holding out our hands when standing, or while
sitting on the benches, and they very soon came, no matter where
we were or in what attitude. The little creatures never seemed to
get tired if we remained hours at a time, and it was indeed difficult
to tear oneself away. Just as I would make up my mind to be off
one would fly over my head calling <i>chick-a-dee-dee</i> in such a bewitching
way as to make it impossible to leave. I would say to myself, "Just
one piece more," then throw a lot of nuts on the ground and make
a 'bee line' for home, never looking back for fear the temptation
would be too great, and I should find myself retracing my steps.
After a time they would come to me and follow me anywhere in the
park, whenever I called them, and getting better acquainted I found
the birds possessed of so many different traits of character that I
named each one accordingly. One I called the 'Scatterer,' because
he stood on my hand and deliberately threw piece after piece of nut
on the ground, looking down as they fell with the most mischievous
twinkle in his eyes, as much as to say, "see what I've done," then
take a piece and fly away. This he did dozens of times in succession.
I thought at first he would rather pick them up from the ground, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">-&#8239;186&#8239;-</a></span>
he came directly back and waited for me to do it. Another I called
'Little Ruffled Breast,' on account of the feathers on the breast being
rough and much darker than the rest. He was the most
affectionate, had a sweet disposition, and, like human beings of the
same character, was often imposed upon, many times being driven
off by the others when he was just about taking a nut. He was
very tame, and had perfect confidence in anyone who would feed
him. The third I named the 'Boss,' because he took the lead
and carried the day. He was a beauty, spick and span in his
dress, not a feather out of place, and plump and perfect in form.
The fourth, dubbed 'Little Greedy,' was very fascinating, and I
must confess to loving him more than the rest, having had a most
novel experience with him, and one never to be forgotten. He
came to me one morning, and, lighting on my hand, sang <i>chick-a-dee-dee</i>
two or three times, helped himself to a nut, and, perching
on my forefinger, put the nut under his foot, as I have seen them
do many a time on the trees, remaining there until he had eaten it.
I was thrilled through and through with the sensation and the
perfect trustfulness of the little creature, and was sorry when he had
finished. But why was he called Greedy? Because he usually
took two pieces instead of one, and, strange to say, knew that he
must have both the same size or one would fall out. It was very
funny to see him with a good sized piece, his bill stretched to its
utmost capacity, trying to fit in another. He turned his bill first
on one side then on the other, thinking he could wedge it in by
forcing it against my hand, and he succeeded in this wonderful
feat by his perseverance and indomitable will.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">A</span>fter seeing Dr. Roberts' interesting <a href="#The_Camera_as_an_Aid_in_the_Study_of_Birds">Chickadee photographs</a>,
published in the first number of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>,
my ambition was aroused to discover a nest of this
species so situated as to afford an opportunity to
secure equally charming pictures of Chickadee life.
Late in May the desire was gratified by the discovery,
at Englewood, N. J., of a Chickadee's nest in a
white birch stub, about four feet from the ground, a height admirably
suited to the needs of bird photography.</p>

<p>I will not here present the results of my study of the parent
birds during their period of incubation, but will pass at once to
that part of my experience which relates to their progeny.</p>

<p>Returning to the nest on June 12th, nothing was to be seen of
either parent, and I feared that they or their offspring had fallen
victims to the countless dangers which beset nesting birds and their
young. Looking about for some clue to their fate, I found on the
ground, near the nest-stub, the worn tail-feathers of the female bird.
The molting season had not yet arrived, nor would she have shed
all these feathers at the same moment. There could, therefore, be
only one interpretation of their presence. Some foe, probably a
Sharp-shinned or Cooper's Hawk, since the predaceous mammals
for the most part hunt at night when the Chickadee would be
snugly sleeping in her nest, had made a dash and grasped her by
the tail, which she had sacrificed in escaping. A moment later the
theory was supported by the appearance of a subdued looking
Chickadee, <i>sans</i> tail, and I congratulated her on her fortunate exchange
of life for a member which of late had not been very decorative
and of which, in any event, nature would have soon deprived
her.</p>

<p>The young proved to be nearly ready to fly, and carefully removing
the front of their log-cabin, a sight was disclosed such as mortal
probably never beheld before, and Chickadee but rarely.</p>

<p>Six black and white heads were raised and six yellow-lined
mouths opened in expressive appeal for food. But this was not
all; there was another layer of Chickadees below, how many it was
impossible to say without disentangling a compact wad of birds
in which the outlines of no one bird could be distinguished. So I
built a piazza, as it were, at the Chickadee threshold, in the shape
of a perch of proper size, and beneath, as a life-net, spread a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">-&#8239;188&#8239;-</a></span>
piece of mosquito-bar. Then I proceeded to individualize the ball
of feathers; one, two, three, to seven were counted without undue
surprise, but when an eighth and ninth were added, I marvelled at
the energy which had supplied so many mouths with food, and at
the same time wondered how many caterpillars had been devoured
by this one family of birds.</p>

<p>Not less remarkable than the number of young&mdash;and no book
I have consulted records so large a brood&mdash;was their condition.
Not only did they all appear lusty, but they seemed to be about
equally developed, the slight difference in strength and size which
existed being easily attributable to a difference in age, some interval,
doubtless, having elapsed between the hatching of the first
and last egg.</p>

<p>This fact would have been of interest had the birds inhabited
an open nest, or a nest large enough for them all to have had an
equal opportunity to receive food, but where only two-thirds of
their number could be seen from above at once it seems remarkable,
that, one or more failing to receive his share of food&mdash;and
a very little neglect would have resulted fatally&mdash;had not been
weakened in consequence and crushed to death by more fortunate
members of the brood. Nor was their physical condition the only
surprising thing about the members of this Chickadee family; each
individual was as clean as though he had been reared in a nest alone,
and an examination of the nest showed that it would have been
passed as perfect by the most scrupulous sanitary inspector. It
was composed of firmly padded rabbit's fur, and except for the
sheaths worn off the growing feathers of the young birds, was absolutely
clean. Later I observed that the excreta of the young were
enclosed in membranous sacs, which enabled the parents to readily
remove them from the nest.</p>

<p>The last bird having been placed in the net, I attempted to pose
them in a row on the perch before their door. The task reminded
me of almost forgotten efforts at building card houses which, when
nearly completed, would be brought to ruin by an ill-placed card.
How many times each Chickadee tumbled or fluttered from his
perch I cannot say. The soft, elastic net spread beneath them
preserved them from injury, and bird after bird was returned to
his place so little worse for his fall that he was quite ready to try
it again. On several occasions eight birds were induced to take
the positions assigned them, then in assisting the ninth to his
allotted place the balance of the birds on either side would be
disturbed and down into the net they would go.</p>

<p>These difficulties, however, could be overcome, but not so the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">-&#8239;189&#8239;-</a></span>
failure of the light at the critical time, making it necessary to expose
with a wide open lens at the loss of a depth of focus.</p>

<p>The picture presented, therefore, does not do the subject justice.
Nor can it tell of the pleasure with which each fledgling for the
first time stretched its wings and legs to their full extent and
preened its plumage with before unknown freedom.</p>

<p>At the same time, they uttered a satisfied little <i>dee-dee-dee</i>, in
quaint imitation of their elders. When I whistled their well-known
<i>phe-be</i> note they were at once on the alert, and evidently expected
to be fed.</p>

</div>

<p>The birds were within two or three days of leaving the nest,
and the sitting over, came the problem of returning the flock to a
cavity barely two inches in diameter, the bottom of which was almost
filled by one bird.</p>

<p>I at once confess a failure to restore anything like the condition
in which they were found, and when the front of their dwelling was
replaced Chickadees were overflowing at the door. If their healthfulness
had not belied the thought, I should have supposed it impossible
for them to exist in such close quarters.</p>

<p>A few days later I found their home deserted, and as no other
pair of Chickadees was known to nest in the vicinity, I imagine them
to compose a troop of birds I sometimes meet in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>N the thirteenth of April last, at Hallock, Minn.,
while afield in the morning after Migration Report
data, I stumbled suddenly upon a Richardson's
Owl, in a willow bush, four feet up, on a
brush-land side-hill, two hundred yards above the
river. A strong wind was blowing, and kept the
willow stems a-swaying and the feathers fluttering,
while the dullness of an overcast sky made quick exposures impossible.
Nevertheless, I hurried home, a mile away, and returned
with camera and plates,&mdash;'Crown' and 'Stanley.' The bird was
still <i>in situ</i>, and leaning, as before, against the upright stem nearest
him, as a brace against the wind. With stop 16, or a little
larger, and time 1/5 to 1/2 second, both according to the conditions of wind
and sky, eight exposures were made, beginning at five feet distance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">-&#8239;191&#8239;-</a></span>
and with waits for lulls in the wind. The bird seemed fearless, but I
dared not try to put him on the alert, nor cause him to open his
eyes. The eighth exposure was made at about two feet, the
camera leisurely dismounted, and the bird then quietly caught
about the back, with the left hand, while his attention was distracted
with the right.</p>

<p>The little captive showed no fight nor did he try to escape so
long as I held him by the feet, in an upright position. But when
his body was clasped he would struggle vigorously. With all the
handling I gave him in taking weights and measures, the only
wounding he caused my hands was made in his attempts to secure
a better grasp of my holding hand. While not actually tame, from
the first he showed ecstatic delight in my stroking of the feathers
on the back of his head,&mdash;chirping delightedly during the process,
with much the manner and voice of a chicken when tucked
under the maternal wing.</p>

<p>While spending his first night of captivity in my study, pending
careful examination, he dropped upon my book-cases several
casts, which are still awaiting analysis. At noon of the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">-&#8239;192&#8239;-</a></span>
day he was placed in the garret, where he had a measure of darkness
and plenty of wing room. Here he ate readily the heads of
food that was left convenient, varying this occupation with the
tearing to pieces of an old Cooper's Hawk skin. So far as I
could judge, he ate only on alternate days.</p>

<p>During the eight days of his sojourn with me, no increase of
tameness was shown; and he would fly when I came near, seeking
the darkest cranny of the garret, scolding me often with the characteristic
anger-note of all the smaller Hawks and Owls. Soon
my captive found a permanent home in the family of the foster-father
of Minnesota ornithology, where, I was soon informed, he
became quickly domesticated,&mdash;eating bits of steak from a chop-stick,
beheading English Sparrows with neat despatch, and drinking from
a teaspoon.</p>

into direct communication with an authority on the birds of his
own region.</p>

<p>The response to our appeal has been most gratifying. Without

cordially endorsed the proposed plan, and signified their willingness
to co&ouml;perate with us in this effort to reach the isolated worker.
Nearly every state in the Union and province in Canada has been

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 128px;">
<img src="images/pg_193.png" width="128" height="199" alt="IN" />
</div>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">IN </span>the first number of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> the author of 'Bird
Studies for Children' says: "Most bird stories will
interest them [children], especially if the birds are
humanized for them by the teller of the tale."
Humanizing, in this connection, means endowing
with human characteristics, and is a process much
in vogue just now among writers of nature-study books
and papers for the use of children and teachers.
Let us see if it is worth doing&mdash;or even is justifiable.</p>

<p>Birds possess some characteristics or qualities which are also
possessed by human beings, and by other animals. These qualities
are not merely "human" then, but are common to many species of
creatures. Since birds already have these qualities, there is no
need of endowing them with them. To "humanize" the birds by
ascribing to them human qualities which they do not and cannot
possess, is only to misrepresent them, and stories which so humanize
them are of no more value, as nature-study or bird-study, than so
many fairy-tales. More than this&mdash;they are positively harmful
because they give, as facts, statements about existing creatures which
are not true. This is not bird-study; it is only telling stories which
interest the children, and which have no value except in keeping them
quiet. The children are not interested in the real birds, for they
are not told about them. They are interested in the stories, invented
for this end, about creatures which the story-teller <i>calls</i> birds but
which are only human characteristics draped on bird forms. Very
slight changes would be needed to make the same stories fit any
humanized animal. The real nature of the bird is left out of these
humanized bird stories and the loss is very great, as always when
truth is left out.</p>

<p>To tell of "Mr. and Mrs. Robin" is well enough, for the titles
merely mean the male and female. To represent them as talking
is well enough, for they certainly communicate with each other and
their young, and putting their communications into human speech is
merely translating them. But to represent them as uttering highly
moral speeches is all wrong, for these are beyond the power of the
birds. The moment that the story humanizes them in any such
way it becomes of no value, because it is false to nature.</p>

<p>The humanizing process is lavishly applied to all sorts of
creatures, even to plants.</p>

<p>For instance, in a very popular book occurs the following:&mdash;"And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">-&#8239;194&#8239;-</a></span>
so the witch-hazel, knowing that neither boy nor girl,
nor bird nor beast nor wind, will come to the rescue of its little
ones, is obliged to take matters into its own hands, and this is
what it does." This is an extreme case of humanizing. The writer
states that this brainless plant <i>knows</i> that its seeds will not be
scattered by children, animals or wind. This implies that the plant
is conscious of its seeds; that it realizes the importance of their
distribution; that it knows what boys, girls, birds, animals and
wind are: that it knows how the seeds of other plants are distributed;
and that it plans a method of scattering its own seed! This
is certainly more mental power than we are warranted in ascribing
to a plant. But children are much interested in the story, and
think the witch-hazel very clever to plan so ingenious a way of
distributing its seeds. That it is not true does not trouble them,
because they do not know it, and I can learn of very few teachers
using this book, who have thought enough about the subjects treated
to realize that they are so humanized as to be untrue to their own
natures. I quote this as an instance of the lengths to which humanizing
may be carried without discovery by the average reader.</p>

<p>Humanizing the creatures takes them out of their own place
in Nature, by endowing them with powers higher than they can
really possess. It sets aside all the laws of evolution, and is not
only untrue to the nature of the individual, but to the principles
which underlie all Nature. Young children are not ready for these
general laws and principles, but it cannot be good pedagogics to
give them ideas in direct contradiction to all those laws which
must be taught them a little later, and which will at once prove
the falseness of this earlier teaching.</p>

<p>"Interest" is not everything in teaching children. Truth
counts for more in the long run, and, especially in Nature study,
may be made quite as interesting as "humanization."</p>

<p>I thank you for offering me an opportunity to be heard in

to me than injustice. Therefore, while it is painful to be
misrepresented, I will answer my critics only by saying that they
have entirely&mdash;I do not say wilfully&mdash;misunderstood me, and that
no one who knows me could for an instant believe me guilty of

<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow many of the younger
readers of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>
know that in Norway,
birds, as well as children, have
Christmas trees? Indeed, it
is said that the children do
not enjoy their own gifts until
they know the birds have been
provided for.</p>

<p>Concerning this beautiful
custom of putting out a yule
sheaf for the birds, Dr. Leonhard
Stejneger, the eminent
Norwegian ornithologist, writes
us that the sheaves are usually
of barley or oats, and are
placed on high poles standing
either in the yard or nailed to
the gable end of one of the
houses, preferably the storehouse
or "stabbur," or on the
stable, but always where they
can be seen from the dwelling
house. Dr. Stejneger adds that the origin of the custom is shrouded
in the mystery of the mythological ages.</p>

<p class="pmb4">Here, then, is a country where, as far as anyone knows, the birds
have always had a Christmas tree, while in America most birds, I
imagine, consider themselves lucky if they chance to find a stray crumb
on Christmas morning. So let us all be good Norwegians this coming
Christmas and see that the birds are well supplied, if not with
sheaves&mdash;at least with crumbs, seed, and grain for the Juncos and
Sparrows, suet, ham-bones, and bacon rinds for the Woodpeckers,
Chickadees, and Nuthatches. And then let us improve on the Norwegian
usage by making every winter day Christmas for the birds,
so that no matter how deep the snow, they may always be sure of
a meal. Then, next March, write and tell <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> of your winter
guests, who they were, and what you have learned of their habits.
To the boy or girl of fourteen years, or under, who sends us the best
account of his or her experience in feeding the birds this winter, we
will give a copy of Mrs. Wright's 'Citizen Bird' or 'Wabeno.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>The accompanying illustration shows an
interesting Ph&oelig;be's nest. It is well-known
that this bird prefers to build close to
some overhead protection, but I have never
seen, and have heard of only one other
similar structure, showing such evidence
of forethought by the builder; for this
bird has constructed a pedestal by means
of which her nest was raised to the desired
height.</p>

<p>The location chosen was three feet or so
back under the piazza roof of a lonely,
unused summer cottage by the shore of
Webster lake, in Franklin, N. H.</p>

<p>The foundations were begun on a door-cap
to the left of, although almost in touch
with, an upright cleat. Soon the builder
made a turn to the right, that the pedestal
might rest firmly against this cleat. From
this point the work continued perpendicularly
full twelve inches, with the breadth
of about three inches and a thickness of
one and one-half inches. Upon this the
enlargement was made for the nest proper,
which was destined to safely cradle her
brood of four.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ellen E. Webster</span>,

<p class="caption3">A Useful Nest-Holder</p>

<p>After the leaves fall many deserted birds'
nests will be exposed to view. The larger
number will still be found serviceable for
study, and in collecting them a note of the
site, height from the ground, if in a tree
or bush, etc., should be made to aid in
their identification.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 179px;">

</div>

<p>The accompanying cut shows a very useful
holder for such specimens. It was designed
by Mr. George B. Sennett, and is
made of annealed wire, about the bottom
of which is tied hair wire, as shown. At
this stage, the nest is placed in the holder,
the four uprights are cut off to the required
height, and bent in or out, in order to
bring them closely to the sides of the nest;
the wrapping with hair wire is then continued
until the nest is firmly bound. In
this way such loosely built nests as those
of the Mourning Dove or Cuckoo may be
held in shape without in the least concealing
their structure.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>


<p class="caption3">A Singing Blue Jay</p>

<p>Not long ago, when the snow covered
the ground several inches deep, I heard as
sweet a little song as one could expect to
hear from a Warbler in May, come from a
clump of small plum trees in the back yard.
Creeping softly in the direction of the
sound, I could see nothing but a stately
Blue Jay perched upon one of the upper
limbs. I waited patiently, and soon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">-&#8239;198&#8239;-</a></span>
song came again, sweet and mellow as before;
this time I could plainly see the Jay's
open bill and the muscular movements of
his throat. I could hardly believe my eyes,
as I had been accustomed to hear only
harsh sounds from a Jay's throat. I raised
to a standing posture, the Blue Jay flew
away. I looked carefully all about, and no
other birds were in sight. This Blue Jay
remained in the neighborhood all winter,
and several times I had the pleasure of
hearing his sweet little song.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Frank E.

<p class="caption3">To Hunt Southern Birds</p>

<p>Rockville Centre, L. I., November 9.&mdash;O.
H. Tuthill and Robert T. Willmarth, of
this village, Benjamin Molitor, of East
Rockaway, and Coles Powell, of Seaford,
started yesterday on a bird skinning and
stuffing expedition to the Florida coast.
The men went aboard of Mr. Molitor's little
28-foot sloop, Inner Beach, which is
fitted with both sails and gas engine.</p>

<p>They take the inside route through bays,
rivers and canals to Beaufort, N. C. From
there on to their destination they will have
to take their chances outside on the ocean.
The men go to shoot all kinds of water
birds, for which there is an unprecedented
demand this season by millinery manufacturers.
After being killed, most of the
birds will be skinned and stuffed roughly
with cotton, and every week shipments will
be made to New York.</p>

<p>Mr. Tuthill is an old hand in the business.
The last time there was a large demand
for birds by the makers of women's
headgear, about twelve years ago, he took
an outfit to Florida and during the winter
shipped 140,000 bird skins to New York.&mdash;<i>Brooklyn

<blockquote>
<p>[We met Mr. Tuthill in Key West in
February, 1892, and heard him state that
during a preceding winter his party had
killed 130,000 birds for millinery purposes,
and the information contained in the above
clipping is doubtless, therefore, accurate.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

Price, $5.</p>

<p>Bird students should be grateful to the
publishers of this invaluable work
for issuing it in an edition which places it
within the reach of all.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for us to add our
meed of praise to what is universally conceded
to be "the best book ever written
about birds." To those of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore's</span>
readers who have not had the fortune to
examine this or the preceding edition, we
may say that the work is based on Professor
Newton's article 'Birds' in the Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britanica which, with the co&ouml;peration
of eminent specialists, has been
enlarged and augmented to make an ornithological
dictionary of over 1,000 pages;
an indispensable work of reference to
every student of ornithology who will find
in its pages an immense amount of information
not elsewhere obtainable.&mdash;F. M. C.</p>

Tommy-Anne and the Three Hearts, by
<span class="smcap">Mabel Osgood Wright</span>. Illustrated by
<span class="smcap">Joseph M. Gleeson</span>. New York, The
Macmillan Company, 1899. Price,
$1.50.</p>

<p>This pretty green and gold covered book,
with its mystical sign of three interlaced
hearts, will be a treasure to the army of
little folks who have so enjoyed its predecessor
'Tommy-Anne.' Not only will they
meet in its pages the delightful Tommy-Anne
herself, but several other old friends:
Obi, the almost too-human Waddles, the
unfortunate Horned Owl, and others. In
this volume Anne&mdash;having dropped the
Tommy from her name, pushes her
"whys" into the several kingdoms of
earth and air. She interviews the "Man
in the Moon," learns the story of the red
man from a talkative Indian arrow head,
and the secrets of the hive from a friendly
honey-bee. Through her magic spectacles
life at the bottom of the sea becomes visible,
and the past history of the earth
comes to light. It may readily be seen
that the author has not forgotten her own
childish "wonderments," and is therefore
eminently fitted to satisfy those of children
to-day, and although the imagination has
full play in the manner of conveying it&mdash;the
"how"&mdash;the information given is
trustworthy. The book, with all its charm
of fantasy may be put into the hands of
children with the assurance that it will
let them into the secrets of many interesting
things in Nature, and leave no sting of
false statements to be corrected as the
years pass on.</p>

<p>The book, as usual with the publications
of the house of Macmillan, is fully illustrated,
beautifully printed and altogether
a pleasure to look at and handle.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Olive

pp. i-ix, 131-387. 4to. Numerous illustrations.
Special edition printed for the
Field Columbian Museum, Chicago, Ill.,
1899.</p>

<p>Mr. Cory has spared neither pains nor
expense to lighten the labors of young ornithologists
in the matter of identification.
Arbitrary 'Keys' arranged on apparently
the simplest plans, a careful use of distinguishing
type, and numberless illustrations
characterize this work, which will
doubtless rank as its talented author's
most valuable and important contribution
to the literature of ornithology.</p>

<p>The present volumes contain only the
analytical keys to families and species, and
apparently are to be followed by others
giving detailed descriptions of plumage
and biographical matter. A list of the
birds of Eastern North America, with the
ranges of the species, is appended to the
second volume.&mdash;F. M. C.</p>

Philadelphia, A. J. Rowland,

<p>In this little volume the Bobolink recounts
the history of his life with particular
reference to his experiences with man.
Due regard has been paid to the known
habits of the bird, and the book seems well
designed to arouse the interest and enlist
the sympathy of children in bird-life. The
colored illustration of the Scarlet Tanager
facing page 64 is wrongly labeled "Summer
Tanager," but beyond this slip we
notice no errors.</p>

<p>Congressman Lacey's introduction shows
that its writer has an adequate conception
of both the economic and &aelig;sthetic value of
birds, of the evils of wantonly destroying
them, and of the need for their protection.&mdash;F. M. C.</p>


<p class="caption3">Book News</p>

<p>In the October number of 'The Osprey,'

A. Lucas, Charles W. Richmond, Paul
Bartsch, William Palmer, Harry C. Oberholser,
and Witmer Stone. Surely here
is "a multitude of counsellors" whose co&ouml;peration
is an assurance that 'The Osprey'
will not only return to its former
high plane, but will doubtless reach a level
of excellence before unknown. We note
with pleasure that the somewhat too
appropriate yellow cover, used during
the preceding editorial administration,
has been changed for one of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore's</span>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the editors of St. Nicholas realize

<p class="center"><b>Bird-Lore's Motto:</b></p>

<p class="center"><i>A Bird in the Bush is Worth Two in the Hand.</i></p>

<hr class="chap" />


<p>We have thus far avoided all mention
of the financial side of the conducting of
<span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>, nor do we now propose to
adopt the course which circumstances,
alas! have so often forced upon popular
natural history journals, of turning the
editorial page into a plea for subscriptions.</p>

<p>We trust, however, that in this concluding
number of our first volume we
may be permitted to make several statements
in which we hope our subscribers
will have a mutual interest.</p>

<p>In the first place, replying to the inquiry
as to whether <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> will not
soon be issued at monthly instead of bi-monthly
intervals, let us say that the
management of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> is with us an
avocation to which we can devote only
the margin of time left from fully occupied
days. To publish it each month
would involve greatly increased labor,
which, under the circumstances, we cannot
assume, and we have attempted to
bridge this difficulty by printing as much
matter in each number as is ordinarily
contained in two numbers of any popular
ornithological journal.</p>

<p>In the end, therefore, the subscriber
receives quite as much for his money,
and in support of this statement we may
be pardoned for calling attention to the
fact that the present volume of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>
contains some 200 pages of text
with over 70 illustrations, more, we believe,
than is offered by any other bird
magazine for the sum of one dollar.</p>

<p>To continue with this unpleasant subject:
being perfectly familiar with the
sad fate which has befallen so many of
our predecessors&mdash;and of which when
this journal was in contemplation our
friends rarely failed to remind us!&mdash;we
did not establish <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> as a money
making enterprise, but as a means of
popularizing a study, the advancement of
which is foremost in our desires, and as
an aid to the cause of the Audubon Societies.</p>

<p>We believe, therefore, we may venture
to say, that our relations with our subscribers
are of a wholly different and
more intimate nature than those which
exist between the publishers and purchasers
of magazines which yield an
adequate money return for labor expended.</p>

<p>We have common interests to the
furtherance of which we, for our part,
are willing to devote no little time and
thought, as we trust is shown by our
announcements for 1900. To properly
carry out our plans, however, it will be
necessary to increase the size of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>,
a step not as yet warranted by
our subscription list. We would, therefore,
ask the co&ouml;peration of every reader
who has at heart the interests of bird
study and bird protection. This co&ouml;peration
may be shown in one or both of
two ways: First, you may aid in increasing
<span class="smcap">Bird-Lore's</span> circulation by securing
new subscribers, by presenting a year's
subscription as a Christmas gift to some
friend who is interested, or whom you
want to interest in birds, or by suggesting
this course to others. Second,
you may assist us by promptly renewing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">-&#8239;202&#8239;-</a></span>
your subscription when it expires, or in
the event of your not caring to re-subscribe,
we ask, as a means of regulating
our edition, that you kindly send us a
postal to that effect.</p>


<p class="caption3">Bird-Lore for 1900</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> for 1900 will, we think,
reach a standard of excellence not before
attained by a journal of popular ornithology.
No effort has been spared to
secure authoritative articles of interest
to the general reader, as well as those of
practical value to the teacher and student.</p>

<p>There will be papers by John Burroughs,
recording the rarer birds he has
observed about his home; by Bradford
Torrey, describing his methods of attracting
winter birds; by Robert Ridgway,
on song birds in Europe and
America; by Otto Widmann, on a visit
to Audubon's birthplace; and also contributions
from William Brewster, E. A.
Mearns, C. Hart Merriam, T. S. Roberts,
and other well-known ornithologists.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">A valuable</span> contribution to the study
of bird migration will be a paper by
Captain Reynaud, in charge of the
Homing Pigeon Service of the French
Army, who will write of his experiments
in this branch of the service.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Attention</span> will be paid to the bird-life
of countries made prominent by recent
events: L. M. McCormick, who has
lately returned from the Philippines,
writing of the birds of Luzon; H. W.
Henshaw, of the birds of Hawaii, where
he has long been a resident; Tappan
Adney, who passed a year in the Klondike,
of the birds of that region; and
F. M. Chapman, of the birds of Cuba.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">A. J. Campbell</span>, the authority on Australian
birds, will also contribute a paper
on foreign birds, describing the remarkable
habits of the Bower Birds, with photographs
of their bowers from nature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> teachers there will be a series of
suggestive articles on methods of teaching
ornithology, by Olive Thorne Miller;
Florence A. Merriam; Marion C. Hubbard,
of Wellesley; Lynds Jones, of Oberlin,
and others, who have made a specialty
of instruction in this branch of
nature study.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Students</span> will be glad to avail themselves
of the assistance offered by <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore's</span>
Advisory Council, a new idea in
self-educational work, the details of
which are announced on <a href="#PUBLISHERS_ANNOUNCEMENT">another page</a>.
Among papers designed more especially
for students will be Ernest Seton-Thompson's
'How to Know the Hawks and
Owls,' illustrated by the author, F. A.
Lucas' 'Tongues of Birds,' also illustrated
by the author, and Professor Pinchot's
'A Method of Recording Observations.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">A paper</span> of unusual value to those who
study birds with the aid of a camera
will be by John Rowley, of the American
Museum of Natural History, who
will describe a recently invented camera
which opens new fields in bird photography.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> 'Young Observers' there will be
articles by other young observers, and
poems and jingles all designed to arouse
and stimulate the child's interest in birds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> illustrations will, if possible, be of
even higher quality than those for which
already <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> has become distinguished.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Audubon Department, under Mrs.
Wright's care, will, as heretofore, print
reports of the great work which is being
done in the interests of bird study and
bird protection, and the series of helpful
articles by its Editor will be continued.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> outline of the leading features of
<span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span> for the coming year will,
we trust, be deemed sufficient warrant
for the belief expressed in our opening
sentence. It will be seen that our difficulty
is not lack of material, but lack of
space, and this difficulty we hope our
subscribers will help us to overcome by
seconding our efforts in their behalf.</p>

<p class="caption3">The Law and the Bird</p>

<p>During the past ten months <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>
has printed interesting statistics concerning
the organization of the various State
Audubon Societies, as well as significant
reports of the progress of their work.
So far so good. There are, of course,
slight differences in the platforms of
these societies regarding by-laws, methods,
fees versus no fees, etc. Upon one
point, however, they all agree&mdash;that
while they deplore the use of the feathers
of wild birds in millinery, the great
point is the education of children to have
the proper regard for bird life.</p>

<p>It is, however, necessary to go a step
behind even this. <i>A priori</i> the bird
must be given a legal status before it
can be protected with any general success,
even by those most willing so to do.
In appealing to the average child of the
public school, it should be remembered
of how many races this average child is
compounded,&mdash;races with instincts concerning
what are called the lower animals,
quite beyond the moral comprehension
of the animal-loving Anglo-Saxon.
To make this average school
child respect the rights of the bird, the
bird must be given a legal status to command,
and not to beg respect. This
child may be appealed to in other ways
and may readily assent to all that you say,
<i>while your personal influence is with
him</i>, but he goes away and forgets; he
does not feel the weight of a merely
moral penalty.</p>

<p>Game birds have this legal status, in a
greater or less degree, in all states, with
perhaps the single exception of Mississippi,
and sportsmen are always on the
alert for infringement of the game laws.</p>

<p>It would seem to me wise for Audubonites
to turn more attention to the
legal status of the class of birds that
they specially seek to protect.</p>

<p>Legislation in this respect is, of
course, difficult to obtain, because many
sportsmen are afraid of weakening the
game laws by stirring up discussion regarding
song birds, etc.; but much more
can be made of the existing laws. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">-&#8239;204&#8239;-</a></span>
these are by no means adequately enforced,
is evident to anyone who notices
the hordes of men and boys prowling,
these autumn days, about woods and
meadows, where legitimate game birds
are unknown, and Robins, Flickers, and
even the smaller migrants are the only
game. It makes one feel that the song
bird protectionists must often "pass by
on the other side," not having the honesty
of their convictions in as militant a degree
as the sportsmen, even when they have
the law to back the bird.</p>

<p>It will doubtless be interesting to open
these 'pages,' during the coming year, to
a presentation and discussion of this
legal status. We should like to receive
the condensed bird laws of every state
possessing such, as well as opinions as
to what birds should be excluded from
protection in the best interests of the
Commonwealth, to the end that there
may be a federation of Audubon Societies
regarding the best method of obtaining
legislation for the protection of
desirable birds not covered by the game
laws.</p>

<p>Be the roads many&mdash;illustrated lectures
to arouse public sentiment, birdless
bonnets, leaflets, thousands of pledge
cards signed by ready sympathizers&mdash;the
goal must be conservative, well
thought out legislation, free from any
taint of emotional insanity. If we are
to keep the bird it must be by the aid
of the law, the only voice that <i>must</i> be
listened to, speaking the only language
understood by all the races that go to
make up the people of the United
States.&mdash;M. O. W.</p>


<p class="caption3">Reports from Societies</p>


<p class="caption4">RHODE ISLAND SOCIETY</p>

<p>An exhibition of birdless hats&mdash;'Audubonnets'
as they have been facetiously
styled&mdash;was held in the parlors of the
Narragansett Hotel, in Providence, on
the 9th of October. The response to
the invitations, which were sent by the
society to the leading milliners, was very
gratifying, nearly all of them entering
cordially into the scheme. About one
hundred and fifty hats were exhibited,
and it is safe to say that such a beautiful
and artistic display of millinery was
never before seen in Providence. Most
of the hats were especially designed for
the occasion, and an endless variety of
styles and trimmings was shown. The
result proved conclusively that the plumage
of wild birds can be easily discarded
without violating the laws of fashion.</p>

<p>The exhibition had been well advertised
and, in spite of unpleasant weather,
the parlors were thronged with visitors
throughout the day. Many sales were
made, the proceeds going to the exhibitors.</p>

<p>Four ribbon prizes were awarded, but
it is the opinion of the committee in
charge that prizes, even of that nature,
were a disadvantage.</p>

<p>The 'Providence News' thus comments
upon the exhibition: "It was only the
other day that the 'News' was moved to
remark from the evidence of the fashion
plates, that bird plumage was to be
more than ever the fashion this season.
But there is evidence that the protest
against it is a mighty one, and if the
birds in other communities have supporters
of the number and character
that they find here in Rhode Island, the
milliners who oppose the sentiment of
the Audubons will at no early day be
compelled to reform or to go out of
business."</p>

<p class="caption4">PENNSYLVANIA SOCIETY</p>

<p>During the year that has followed the
issuing of our second annual report the
Society has spread to nearly every county
in the State. The membership has
grown from 3,300 to 5,000, and a steady
increase of interest is shown in the
letters received by the secretary.</p>

<p>Bird-Day was most successfully observed
in a large number of schools, and
both teachers and pupils seemed well
pleased with the results. We owe thanks
to many of our local secretaries for their
good work among children, and for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">-&#8239;205&#8239;-</a></span>
classes for bird study which they formed
during the summer. This is a movement
of the utmost importance, as with
increasing membership it becomes more
and more difficult for the secretary to
conduct individual correspondence, and
everyone who will band together local
members and act as local secretary, will
further the interests of the Society more
than can be done in any other way.</p>

<p>We would like to call the attention of
our members to the following:</p>

<p>1. When this Society was organized
the quills used in millinery were all
taken from large domestic birds. Lately
the Brown Pelican, Eagles, Owls, and
Turkey Vulture have been made to pay
tribute to the fashions; and we wish
most earnestly to protest against the use
of these quills. A good illustration of
the feathers to be avoided will be found
in the October number of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>.</p>

<p>2. We would also call attention to the
fact that this magazine is the official
organ of the Audubon Societies, and is
essential to anyone desiring to keep up
with what is being done for the protection
of birds.</p>

<p>3. As heretofore, we are dependent
almost entirely upon voluntary subscriptions
for carrying on the objects of the
organization, and we therefore appeal
again for assistance from those interested
in furthering the cause of the protection
of birds. Increased funds will,
of course, enable us to reach a larger
number of persons, and to issue a larger
amount of literature, for which there is
a constant demand. Donations should
be forwarded to the treasurer, Mr.
William L. Baily, 421 Chestnut street,
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>For the coming year we have in view
the usual course of lectures, by Mr.
Stone, and also the furthering of bird
study in the schools, to which end we
hope to issue some educational circulars.</p>

<p class="caption4">THE WISCONSIN SOCIETY</p>

<p>Our busy season is in the spring of
the year. At about Easter time our
State Superintendent of Schools issued
his 'Arbor and Bird-Day Annual,' which
contained an invitation to teachers and
children to join the Audubon Society.
This invitation brought an almost overwhelming
response, every day for several
weeks bringing me ten or fifteen
letters from would-be branches, and our
school membership mounted rapidly to
over 10,000. A prize offered to these
children for the best personal observation
on a Bird Family was won by a
little country girl, who wrote a very good
composition on the Ground Sparrow. We
have tried, with varying degrees of success,
in different places, to institute the
work of the 'Bird Restorers' among
these children.</p>

<p>We shall soon have a little library of
bird books circulating among the
schools, and we are trying to raise
money for a set of lantern slides to accompany
a lecture&mdash;lecture and slides
to be sent from place to place.</p>

<p>I believe that the Audubon work has
already made a deep impression in Wisconsin.
The milliners' windows abound
in Gulls and Birds of Paradise, but they
are not finding a ready sale. As to
wings, perhaps it is too much to expect
that women will not believe their milliners
when told that "These wings are
all right, because they are made."</p>

<p class="tdr">

<p class="caption4">The Passing of the Tern</p>

<p>The surprising results which may follow
Fashion's demand for a certain kind
of bird have never been more clearly
shown than in the case of the Terns or
Sea Swallows of our Atlantic coasts.</p>

<p>Useless for food, the birds had escaped
the demands of the hunter, and thousands
nested in security along our
beaches. The exquisite purity of their
plumage and their unsurpassed gracefulness
on the wing made them a particularly
grateful element of the coast
scenery to every lover of the beautiful,
while to the prosaic fisherman they often
gave welcome evidence of the direction
of the land, as with unerring flight they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">-&#8239;206&#8239;-</a></span>
returned through the densest fogs, bearing
food to their young.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as a result of causes too
mysterious for the mind of man to comprehend,
Fashion claimed the Terns for
her own.</p>

<p>Up and down the coast word went
forth, that Sea Swallows, or 'Summer
Gulls,' were worth ten cents each, and
the milliner's agent was there to confirm
the report.</p>

<p>It was in June when the baymen were
idle and, unrestrained by law, they
hastened to the beaches in keen competition
to destroy the birds which were
nesting there.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 451px;">

WILSON'S TERN ON NEST</span>
</div>

<p>Never, in this country, at least, has
there been such a slaughter of birds. A
Cobb's Island, Virginia, bayman, whose
conscience, even at this late date, urged
him to a confession of shame for his
part in the proceedings, told me recently
that in a single day of that memorable
season, 1,400 Terns were killed on Cobb's
Island alone, and 40,000 are said to have
been there shot during the summer. The
destruction at other favorable places was
proportionately great.</p>

<p>Two seasons of this work were sufficient
to sweep the Terns from all their
more accessible resorts, the only survivors
being residents of a few uninhabited
islands. Even here they would have
succumbed had not bird-lovers raised a
sum to pay keepers to protect them.</p>

<p>Then Fashion, as if content with the
destruction she had wrought, found fresh
victims, and the Terns, for a time, escaped
persecution. Now, however, the
demand for them has been revived, and
again the milliners' agent is abroad placing
a price on the comparatively few
birds remaining. Before me is a circular
issued by a New York feather dealer,
asking for "large quantities" of "Sea
Gulls, Wilson's Turns (<i>sic</i>), Laughing
Gulls, Royal Gulls," etc., and this is
only one instance among hundreds. In
fact, the feather merchants themselves
state that the demand for Terns and
Gulls exceeds the supply.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_J_10" id="Footnote_J_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_J_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> See also note from 'Brooklyn Eagle' on <a href="#Page_198">page 198</a>.</p></div>

<p>What will be the result? Is there no
appeal from Fashion's decree? Woman
alone can answer these questions, and
the case is so clear she cannot shirk the
responsibility of replying.</p>

<p>Aigrettes are decorative, quills difficult
to identify, neither bespeak death, and
ignorance may lead the most humane
woman into wearing either. But with
the Tern no such excuse exists, and the
woman who places its always disgustingly
mutilated body on her bonnet, does
so in deliberate defiance of the laws of
humanity and good taste.</p>

<p class="caption4"><span class="undrln">Photographing Birds and Butterflies in Colors</span></p>

<p>Color photography has surely
come to stay. We have published
three volumes illustrated
in this manner, and the
pictures will probably surprise you
unless you have kept up with such
matters very closely. They are
photographed direct from the birds
and butterflies, and only three colors
are used in printing; yet the results
are generally <i>absolutely accurate</i>
renderings of the original hues.
Their price is about one-twentieth of
what such books could have been
bought for a few years ago.</p>

<p>"The Butterfly Book," by Dr. W.
J. Holland (already in its second
edition), has, besides hundreds of
text illustrations, 48 colored plates,
which show over a thousand species
of American butterflies, with all their
native beauty and brilliance of coloring.
It tells everything about
butterflies, and tells it in a way anybody
can understand. The price is
$3 net.</p>

<p>Neltje Blanchan's "Birds that
Hunt and are Hunted" (10th thousand)
gives the life-histories of 173
of our game and water birds and
birds of prey. You can actually see
the iridescent sheen on the neck of
the wild pigeon that serves as a
frontispiece, and the other 47 plates
are equally remarkable. Quite as
remarkable also is the price: $2.</p>

<p>"Bird Neighbors," by the same
author, has 52 colored plates, and
describes 150 of the song birds and
other more common feathered neighbors.
With the aid of these life-like
plates there can be not the least
doubt as to the identification of
a bird. It is almost a sufficient commentary
on the volume that we have
had to print 20,000 copies in the year
since it appeared. It costs $2.</p>

<p><b>Any or all of these books sent, postpaid,

<p class="center">SECOND EDITION (1895), THOROUGHLY REVISED</p>


<p>The preface of this work defines its scope and object, and includes selections from
the A. O. U. Code of Nomenclature, of special importance in the present connection.
The table of contents consists of a systematic list of the orders, sub-orders and families
of North American birds. The check-list proper gives the scientific and common name,
number in previous list, and geographical distribution of the 1,068 species and sub-species,
constituting the North American Avifauna. This is followed by a list of birds
of doubtful status, and a list of the fossil birds of North America.</p>

<p>This new edition has been carefully revised; the recent changes in nomenclature,
and species and sub-species described since the publication of the first edition in 1886,
are included, while the portion relating to geographical distribution has been much
amplified.</p>

<p>As the official organ of the Union, 'The Auk' is the leading ornithological publication
of this country. Each number contains about 100 pages of text, a handsomely
colored plate, and other illustrations. The principal articles are by recognized authorities,
and are of both a scientific and popular nature. The department of 'General
Notes' gives brief records of new and interesting facts concerning birds, contributed
by observers from throughout the United States and Canada. Recent ornithological
literature is reviewed at length, and news items are commented upon by the editors.
'The Auk' is thus indispensable to those who would be kept informed of the advance
made in the study of birds, either in the museum or in the field.</p>

<p>As the official organ of the Union, 'The Auk' is the leading ornithological publication
of this country. Each number contains about 100 pages of text, a handsomely
colored plate, and other illustrations. The principal articles are by recognized authorities,
and are of both a scientific and popular nature. The department of 'General
Notes' gives brief records of new and interesting facts concerning birds, contributed
by observers from throughout the United States and Canada. Recent ornithological
literature is reviewed at length, and news items are commented upon by the editors.
'The Auk' is thus indispensable to those who would be kept informed of the advance
made in the study of birds, either in the museum or in the field.</p>

recorded. The Scheme of Classification is of great value to the Student.</p>

<p>"<i>There is nothing in modern story telling which equals the tale of the capture of the pacing

<p class="tdr">
&mdash;New York <i>Mail and Express</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"The originality and freshness of these stories
is irresistible&#8230;. In everything he does,
Mr. Thompson has a way peculiarly his own.
Even if naked and unadorned, the facts he tells
us would be very interesting; but when we have
the facts and the factors fairly dancing before us,
clothed in all the quaint quips and droll persiflage
of an accomplished humorist and born story-teller,
they are&mdash;as I have said&mdash;irresistible."</p>

<p class="tdr">
&mdash;Mr. W. T. Hornaday, in <i>Recreation</i>.<br />

<p>"Mr. Thompson holds our unflagging interest
in his stories. He knows his animals as individual
characters, and sets forth their lives vividly,
making us feel for and with them, through
all their vicissitudes to the appointed death by
violence. The book is thoroughly good, both in
purpose and execution; it should find a wide
circle of interested readers, to whose sympathies
it appeals so strongly and so humanly."</p>

<p>The central idea of these books is to <i>hold the child's interest</i> by giving him
reading matter (profusely illustrated) that he <i>can understand and enjoy</i>. The lessons,
therefore, relate exclusively to <i>child life</i>.</p>

<p>The First and Second Readers have <i>easier reading-matter</i> and <i>more of it</i> than
do most of the other readers now available for first and second year. They have been
graded with the utmost care.</p>

<p>These books, beginning with the Second Reader, have been planned as an <i>introduction
to literature</i>. The subject-matter, therefore, is confined to material of <i>recognized
literary value</i>.</p>

<p>The aim of the publishers has been to produce <i>an artistic set of Readers</i> that
shall be mechanically as nearly perfect as possible.</p>

<p>As a unique feature in binding, they would call attention to the <i>covers, which are
water-proof</i>, and can be cleansed, when soiled by constant handling, without injury to
the book.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE GULF FAUNA AND FLORA BULLETIN</p>

<p>Will be issued as a bi-monthly from the Louisiana Industrial Institute Press, and edited by
writers on biology. It will be made a bulletin of original research, and be kept in close
touch with all science societies of the Gulf section, most especially with the Louisiana State
Biological Station, soon to be opened. As the name implies, the Bulletin will be devoted to
the biological interests of the Gulf section. It aims to take the place of no other publication,
but, on the other hand, hopes to encourage the increased circulation of biological literature,
and the unification of the interests of working biologists generally.</p>

<p>The editors invite long or short articles; catalogues of animals or plants; sketches of
past work of societies or individuals; reviews of books or other scientific publications.
Articles too short for extended or general treatment, or papers too long or technical for semi-popular
treatises, are especially invited. In short, the aim is to make a bulletin rather than a
popular science journal.</p>

<p>The following are some of the articles now ready for publication:</p>

<p><b>Catalogue of Reptiles of Arkansas</b>; <b>History of Louisiana Botany</b>; <b>The Louisiana
Gulf Biological Station</b>; <b>The Louisiana Society of Naturalists</b>; <b>A Bill before Congress
for the Creation of a Government Biological Station and Fish Hatchery on the Louisiana
Coast</b>; <b>Review of the Proceedings of the National Fishery Congress</b>; <b>Some Special Features
of Avery's Island</b>; <b>The Behavior of Birds around their Nests or Young</b>.</p>

<p>The size of the Bulletin will be 8<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> × 10 inches. Each number will contain not less than
thirty pages, six numbers constituting a volume. Subscription, $2.50 per volume. The date
of issue may be irregular, each number being held till sufficient original matter be obtained
to warrant an issue. We invite comments and criticisms, as well as contributions and subscriptions,
from biologists.</p>

<p class="caption3">Oom Paul's People</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By <span class="smcap">Howard C. Hillegas</span>. With illustrations.
12mo, cloth, $1.50.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="smaller">"Oom Paul's People" is the title of an exceedingly timely
and interesting book, presenting clearly for the first time in this
country the Boer's side of the Transvaal Question. The author is
Howard C. Hillegas, a New York newspaper man, who spent
nearly two years in South Africa, enjoying special facilities at
the hands of President Kruger and other Boer officials, as well as
from Sir Alfred Milner and other British representatives at Cape
Colony. The book contains an important interview with Oom
Paul, and a special study of Cecil Rhodes. The author blames
stock jobbers and politicians for all the trouble between the Boers
and the English, and believes that war is the probable final outcome.
One chapter is especially devoted to the American interests
in South Africa, showing that, while British capital owns the
vast gold mines, American brains operate them. The book is
eminently readable from first to last.</p>

<p class="caption3">Averages</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Novel. By <span class="smcap">Eleanor Stuart</span>, author of "Stonepastures."
12mo, cloth, $1.50.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="smaller">Novels of New York have sometimes failed through lack of
knowledge of the theme, but the brilliant author of "Averages"
and "Stonepastures" has had every opportunity to know her
New York well. She has been able, therefore, to avoid the extremes
of "high life" and "low life," which have seemed to
many to constitute the only salient phases of New York, and she
paints men and women of every day, and sketches the curious
interdependence and association or impingement of differing circles
in New York. It is a story of social life, but of a life exhibiting
ambitions and efforts, whether wisely or ill directed, which
are quite outside of purely social functions. There is a suggestion
of the adventurer, a figure not unfamiliar to New Yorkers,
and there are glimpses of professional life and the existence of
idlers. "Averages" is not a story of froth or slums, but a brilliant
study of actualities, and its publication will attract increased
attention to the rare talent of the author.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="smaller">Mr. Hope's new romance pictures the life of a prince and king
under conditions modern, and yet shared by representatives of
royalty almost throughout history. In the subtle development of
character nothing that this brilliant author has written is shrewder
than this vivid picture of a king's inner life. It is a romance
which will not only absorb the attention of readers, but impress
them with a new admiration for the author's power. "The King's
Mirror" is accompanied by a series of apt and effective illustrations
by Mr. Frank T. Merrill.</p>

<p>This new novel by the popular author of "Dodo" is bound to
attract much attention. It deals with personages living in the
same society that was characterized in the former novel. Mr.
Benson, it will be remembered, is a son of the Archbishop of
Canterbury, and is thoroughly acquainted with the society in
which he places the scenes of his novels of London life. In
"Mammon and Co." the good genius of the tale is an American
girl.</p>

A. R. Dugmore. 12mo, $1.50.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="smaller pmb2">A charming vein of humor and philosophy runs through Mr. Lanier's affectionately
intimate story of his pet Mocking Bird Bob, giving the book a literary quality
of an altogether unusual kind and setting it in a niche of its own. The illustrations
have been made with great pains and skill from nature. They portray a Mocking
Bird from his birth to the period of full growth. Reproduced in colors from carefully
made and painted photographs, they are as artistic as they are in perfect harmony
with the author's delightful narrative, numerous passages of which they illustrate.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As was the case with his "Wild Animals I Have Known" (now in its twentieth
thousand), Mr. Seton-Thompson has given this new book a unique individuality of form,
bringing to its embellishment many novel and original ideas. And the story, which is
the longest, as it is the most noteworthy, that the author has published, is well deserving
of his pains; for never have the glory and the joy of the chase been interpreted
so vividly, never the thoughts of the hunted animal so surely read and pictured.</p>

<p class="caption2">THE GULF FAUNA AND FLORA BULLETIN</p>

<p class="p0">Will be issued as a bi-monthly from the Louisiana Industrial Institute Press, and edited by
writers on biology. It will be made a bulletin of original research, and be kept in close
touch with all science societies of the Gulf section, most especially with the Louisiana State
Biological Station, soon to be opened. As the name implies, the Bulletin will be devoted to
the biological interests of the Gulf section. It aims to take the place of no other publication,
but, on the other hand, hopes to encourage the increased circulation of biological literature,
and the unification of the interests of working biologists generally.</p>

<p>The editors invite long or short articles; catalogues of animals or plants; sketches of
past work of societies or individuals; reviews of books or other scientific publications.
Articles too short for extended or general treatment, or papers too long or technical for semi-popular
treatises, are especially invited. In short, the aim is to make a bulletin rather than a
popular science journal.</p>

<p>The following are some of the articles now ready for publication:</p>

<p><b>Catalogue of Reptiles of Arkansas; History of Louisiana Botany; The Louisiana
Gulf Biological Station; The Louisiana Society of Naturalists; A Bill before Congress
for the Creation of a Government Biological Station and Fish Hatchery on the Louisiana
Coast; Review of the Proceedings of the National Fishery Congress; Some Special Features
of Avery's Island; The Behavior of Birds around their Nests or Young.</b></p>

<p>The size of the Bulletin will be 8<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> x 10 inches. Each number will contain not less than
thirty pages, six numbers constituting a volume. Subscription, $2 .50 per volume. The date
of issue may be irregular, each number being held till sufficient original matter be obtained
to warrant an issue. We invite comments and criticisms, as well as contributions and subscriptions,
from biologists.</p>

<p>As the official organ of the Union, 'The Auk' is the leading ornithological publication
of this country. Each number contains about 100 pages of text, a handsomely
colored plate, and other illustrations. The principal articles are by recognized authorities,
and are of both a scientific and popular nature. The department of 'General
Notes' gives brief records of new and interesting facts concerning birds, contributed
by observers from throughout the United States and Canada. Recent ornithological
literature is reviewed at length, and news items are commented upon by the editors.
'The Auk' is thus indispensable to those who would be kept informed of the advance
made in the study of birds, either in the museum or in the field.</p>

<p class="caption4">By <span class="smcap">Archibald J. Campbell</span>, Melbourne</p>


<p>Mr. A. J. Campbell has pleasure in announcing to his American cousins in ornithology,
and to all lovers of '<span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>,' that he has completed his life-long work on
Australian birds, particularly with regard to their domestic history.</p>

<p>It has been computed that the MSS. will cover nearly 1,000 pages, royal octavo
size, and there will be about 130 photographic reproductions of nests, nesting scenes, etc.
(many taken under exceptional and difficult circumstances); also figures of over 200 eggs,
colored according to nature.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the expensiveness of the illustrations, it is expected that the price
of the book, to original subscribers, will be about ten (certainly not exceeding twelve)
dollars.</p>

<p>Provided there be enough support, Messrs. Dawson &amp; Brailsford, Printers and
Publishers, Sheffield, England, have offered to undertake the publication of this work.
Mr Campbell has every reason to believe that the needed number will be secured if
applicants thoughtfully send their names, as early as possible, to his agent,</p>

many others. A free sample copy may be had by addressing the publishers.</p>

be believed that no present could be more appropriate for
a friend who is interested in birds, or a friend whom you
wish to interest in birds, than <b>BIRD-LORE</b> for the coming
year. As the first number of the new volume will not be
issued until February 1, 1900, we have had prepared a <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>
Christmas Card. The face, printed in colors, bears <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore's</span>

<p>On the reverse is placed the much admired, full-page portrait of John Burroughs,
published in the first number of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>. A heavy plate paper will be used in
making this card, it will be so packed as to insure its arrival in condition suitable for
framing, and it therefore forms in itself a desirable Christmas remembrance.</p>

<p>On receipt of the subscription price to <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>, and the name and address of
the person to whom you wish the magazine sent, this card will be properly filled out
and mailed in time to be received on Christmas day.</p>

<p>Or the subscription may be sent and we will forward the Christmas Card in
blank, to be filled in and mailed by the donor of the Magazine.</p>

<p>For this occasion we will make a reduction in the subscription price to <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>,
and offer five subscriptions for the sum of $4.00.</p>

<p>Orders for these Christmas Cards should be sent at an early date, in order to
ensure their delivery in due season.</p>

<p>In this connection we would call attention to the fact that, having reprinted the
first (February) number of <span class="smcap">Bird-Lore</span>, we can now supply volume one complete,
and, if desired, on receipt of two dollars, will deliver it with the Christmas Card to
any address on Christmas day.</p>

numerous marginal illustrations from drawing by the author Square 8vo, $1.50</i></p>


<p>"A more delightful bit of impressionist work, subtle
word-painting and that best of all teaching which conveys
its lesson unconsciously is not often found. It is a reproof
of the blood thirst in the hunter, a plea for the harmless
and gentle denizen of the forest and mountain, a sermon
which Buddha might have preached and a marvel of
artistic creation all in one."&mdash;Chicago <i>Evening Post</i>.</p>

<p>"Could you call that an ordinary hunting story? I
should call it a piece of imaginative literature worthy of
Stevenson&#8230;. There are hundreds of men who could
follow a stag through half a dozen snowy winters; there
are few who could paint him; but if Mr. Thompson is not
the first to interpret the joys of the wild chase in words, he
is yet the best."&mdash;New York <i>Commercial Advertiser</i>.</p>

<p>A charming vein of humor and philosophy runs through Mr. Lanier's affectionately intimate story of his pet mocking

illustrations have been reproduced in colors from carefully made and painted photographs, and are as artistic as they
are in perfect harmony with the author's delightful narrative, passages of which they illustrate.</p>
